from
this
you
can
conclude
that
nazi
but
he
did
not
enter
into
any
fascist
organization
so
the
employee
can
not
be

also

we

one
note
if
you
make

in
the

strange
link

propose
to

ukrainian
pages
here
card
it
seemed
like
such
a
man
card
add
and
is
it
something
distinguished
he
was
in
the
oun
in
prison
still
do
not
know
what
made
a
national
hero
i
understand
the
heroes
can
be
put
like
but
al
well
so
is
long
note
turkish
strange
conclusion
was
not
part
of
any
nazi
organization
so
it
can
not
be
fascist
in
fact
to
be
called
so
it
is
important
not
membership
in
some
organizations
but
only
the
act
of
cooperation
this
is
evident
even
from
the
point
of
view
of
common
sense
this
article
is
not
neutral
there
errors
for
example
the
great
patriotic
war
called
what
is
at
least
a
everything
will
be
better
because
germany
is
not
at
war
with
russia
and
the
soviet
union
i
think
this
fact
to
deny
you
anything
which
included
and
in
this
instance
it
does
not
matter
how
to
treat
it
because
it
is
also
a
fact
and
as
the
nazis
destroyed
the
russians
and
ukrainian
and
many
ukrainian
my
for
example
fought
against
the
germans
can
from
your
point
of
view
these
were
two
different
war
the
and
i
think
that
the
article
should
be
i
have
some
comments
questions
the
proposal
in
the
second
sentence
i
understand
that
all
the
leaders
of
the
along
with
etc
with
military
who
taught
fly
and
shoot
the
german
military
in
the
soviet
union
in
a
friendly
exchange
all
the
who
chronicle
where
soviet
military
with
friends
nazis
offered
called
fascist
officers
may
have
as
a
result
will
be
called
fascist
communist
regime
as
you
can
see
there
is
some
confusion
with
your
text
please
clarify
the
position
clearer
for
war
in
articles
on
implies
that
russians
call
second
that
began
in
i
understand
that
in
was
occupied
by
soviet
troops
and
the
germans
in
etc
met
first
of
course
then
the
situation
has
changed
with
bread
and
salt
and
flowers
of
course
you
can
call
that
war
as
you
say
the
everything
will
be
better
because
germany
is
not
at
war
with
russia
and
the
soviet
union
but
so
could
be
considered
only
in
the
kremlin
do
you
think
that
possibly
other
soviet
peoples
nations
except
the
russians
it
was
a
war
of
aggression
against
their
oppressor
while
it
is
difficult
to
say
how
it
would
all
have
happened
if
first
attacked
dear
i
would
like
to
hear
your
opinion
on
the
comments
to
your
thoughts
willingly
answer
i
completely
agree
that
for
some
time
the
person
who
made
the
kremlin
elite
were
nazi
officers
or
call
fascist
communist
regime
let
everyone
for
himself
it
seems
to
me
the
question
rather
moral
and
emotional
rather
than
terminology
for
teachers
etc
there
is
a
different
matter
they
the
top
and
pursued
a
policy
on
its
instructions
unlike
those
who
are
the
fate
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
union
the
little
people
had
no
choice
a
nobody
ordered
to
seek
allies
in
nazi
camps
regarding
the
second
topic
the
war
no
one
seems
to
be
called
second
great
patriotic
war
there
are
term
second
world
war
and
the
great
patriotic
war
youre
right
that
for
russia
this
world
war
ii
really
was
the
second
after
but
the
patriotic
war
against
napoleon
historians
have
called
the
great
in
was
part
of
the
union
attacked
not
russia
and
the
soviet
union
i
think
that
with
the
formal
side
is
still
the
war
the
term
war
should
have
the
right
to
exist
in
this
case
if
the
germans
have
limited
their
attempts
only
through
russia
without
affecting
but
we
know
that
is
not
true
is
that
considered
actions
of
the
germans
on
the
territory
of
a
war
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
quite
illogical
now
with
regard
to
the
informal
side
flowers
nazis
met
not
all
ukrainian
and
it
is
also
a
fact
then
in
the
situation
for
many
looked
like
this
we
live
on
this
earth
and
came
to
us
in
arms
just
to
us
but
not
to
the
russians
and
the
kremlin
it
is
logical
to
give
them
much
of
the
ukrainian
immediately
went
to
fight
against
the
germans
went
voluntarily
to
the
above
reasons
too
large
part
to
her
neglect
those
who
supported
the
germans
in
the
ukrainian
land
that
the
germans
would
save
them
from
moscow
those
who
immediately
went
to
the
front
believed
that
germans
were
their
slaves
i
repeat
i
am
talking
about
those
who
fought
voluntarily
and
not
as
a
result
of
the
order
the
fact
that
he
was
right
still
arguing
but
what
many
saw
themselves
as
ukrainian
citizens
of
the
union
is
could
for
this
reason
they
can
not
be
called
ukrainian
by
the
way
from
your
point
of
view
as
i
understand
only
the
war
was
the
and
in
berlin
therefore
thought
that
fighting
alone
with
alone
with
and
separately
with
other
countries
something
is
questioned
first
of
all
lets
clarify
the
term
employee
nazi
maybe
we
disagree
somewhat
in
terms
so
specify
now
regarding
of
to
was
actually
divided
one
part
was
in
poland
and
the
other
in
was
occupied
as
a
result
of
the
war
the
part
that
actually
belonged
to
poland
was
also
occupied
although
it
was
democratic
will
of
the
people
of
western
i
have
now
to
your
question
if
it
so
follow
your
logic
then
still
part
for
it
was
generally
the
first
war
right
for
the
soviet
union
attacked
poland
and
later
germany
the
soviet
union
and
so
this
war
was
the
war
it
is
for
most
ukrainian
as
i
know
even
given
the
fact
that
someone
in
the
in
voluntarily
joined
the
ranks
of
the
soviet
army
in
the
period
immediately
after
the
german
invasion
of
the
soviet
union
though
if
im
not
mistaken
the
territory
of
was
occupied
by
very
fast
too
much
it
is
for
the
as
a
force
that
fought
for
the
establishment
of
an
independent
and
ukrainian
which
have
supported
much
more
than
historians
have
tried
to
present
but
it
is
also
very
significant
part
of
the
population
of
what
was
then
the
soviet
union
the
war
was
really
the
or
or
in
your
form
but
that
ukrainian
itself
or
with
the
or
the
russians
did
not
identify
the
front
quickly
passed
and
here
was
formed
therefore
in
the
context
of
the
article
because
of
the
period
including
one
who
basically
then
fought
for
the
far
too
difficult
to
make
some
changes
in
the
definition
of
ps
i
generally
tend
to
more
neutral
on
the
one
hand
and
not
russian
that
will
satisfy
you
and
the
other
words
used
to
denote
the
time
of
power
which
gives
a
clear
tone
and
definition
regarding
second
great
patriotic
is
too
bad
you
spent
a
lot
of
time
but
the
explanation
was
not
worth
it
but
concerns
about
berlin
and
against
whom
he
fought
a
bit
distracting
from
the
issues
course
on
self
the
soviet
union
the
essence
lies
in
the
perception
of
the
soviet
union
and
its
territory
due
to
the
fact
often
synonymous
definition
russian
thats
all
for
example
in
the
present
article
de
maybe
its
not
the
best
example
but
still
you
understand
what

it

a

it

only

you
can
also
say
that
all
those
who
fought

also
condemned
by
the
whole

agree

his

see
alexander
not
a

but
only
and
journalist
he
does
not
have
a
degree
been
published
in
scientific
ie
it
is
not
an
authoritative
source
on
the
history
of
perhaps
somewhat
emotional
determination
of
its
staff
as
a
quite
often
can
be
found
in
various

i
would
like
to
see
these
materials
not
russian
in
the
of
soviet
propaganda
the
soviet
government
and
the
did
everything
possible
to
discredit
the
oun
and
as
soviet
sources
can
not
be
considered
objective
if
the
germans
with
they
must
be
german
documents
about
this
a
fudge
soviet
propaganda
is
not
a
reliable
source
do
you
have
objective
data
that
specifically
these
statements
are
false
do
i
need
to
prove
that
the
soviet
propaganda
based
on
lies
dear
i
asked
a
specific
question
i
see
that
you
have
nothing
to
say
on
specific
documents
according
to
the
rules
op
dr
and
vp
users
should
not
give
opinions
on
primary
sources
what
is
similar
generally
the
use
documents
not
welcome
on
because
of
the
possibility
of
speculation
on
the
basis
of
such
documents
therefore
you
must
submit
evidence
of
historians
on
these
materials
and
reference
to
the
same
can
be
just
as

july
this

a
little

better

though
quite
but
the

is
no

very
dubious
source
actually
about

so
i
do
not

that
this

the

here
is
another
very
neutral

very
authoritative

i
do
not
need

not
what
you

this
author
of
the
formal
part
of

is
better
than
anonymous
but
does
not
in
history
when
she
writes
about
his

it
deserves
attention
but
only
in
comparison
with
other

i
do
not
know
what
a

because
it

if
you
compare
your

of
what
you
wrote
earlier
you
just
stubbornly
the
same
thing
without
citing
authoritative
sources
then
i
is
the
belief
that
we
are
wasting
your
time
articles
to

such
as

that

nothing

for
i
understand
what
you
tried
to
do
like
in

better
the
fact
is
that
if
you
continue
to
hold
an
opinion
on
the
credibility
of

on
such
external
superficial

as
it
does
for

a

if
we
have
already

about

im
not
talking
about
that

sources
are

and
which
also
just

thats
me
in

i
doubt
that
at
least
in
such
at

holding
the
or
something
of
course
the
humanism
of
germans
those
we
discussed
in
the
context
of
the
events
we
have
from
the
used
to
call
the
germans
particularly
the
gestapo
etc
for

not
out
of
the
question
it
is
clear
that
they
regarded
him
as
a
great
figure
and
had
big
plans
to
him
especially
at
a
time
when
they
already
were
ready
to
grasp
at
because
trying
to
attach
themselves
oun
and
as
an
ally
against
moscow
is
quite
logical
clearly
used
this
interest
for
their
own
purposes
but
it
is
unclear
at
least
to
me
and
many
others
or
was
it
a
commitment
and
if
taken
which
ones
the
same
applies
in
the
period
to
september
and
the
period
after
the
liberation
in
so
if
you
set
up
to
search
authoritative
sources
such
influential
works
of
professional
historians
with
detailed
references
to
primary
documents
followed
by
a
thorough
study
of
those
works
then
ill
be
happy

assist
you

a
court
order
circus
not
a
hero
not
a
hero
will
continue
i
wonder
he
hero
of
for
anyone
because
although
court
the
decision
but
all
outside
the
law
he
did
not
even
have
the
right
to
consider
this
matter
the
president
of
can
only
either
the
president
of
and
court
of
appeals
and
not
some
peripheral
court
for
a
state
right
just
in
our
country
under
the
laws
even
judges
do
not
live
removed
recent
changes
totally
agree
with
he
is
not
a
hero
and
not
to
decide
legitimate
or
illegitimate
is
the
decision
of
the
court
of
the
decision
was
not
so
he
is
not
a
hero
of
i
w
those
who
now
as
a
patriot
and
so
zealously
protect
the
constitution
initially
at
least
read
it
for
protect
such
fundamental
law
of
the
country
magazine
when
i
spoke
of
i
was
referring
to
politicians
who
bow
to
the
constitution
of
the
ridiculous
sense
th
the
fact
is
that
if
the
decision
is
illegal
it
is
canceled
example
the
constitution
of
the
decision
and
the
consequences
in
that
case
why
did
raise
a
fuss
even
if
after
judgment
he
remains
this
award
if
only
embroil
the
country
election
promises
had
to
perform
idiotic
decision
sorry
otherwise
i
can
not
say
since
and
and
and
and
party
were
by
december
in
finally
took
the
title
the
more
idiotic
decision
that
the
official
reason
for
leaving
as
for
me
the
plate
should
be
a
little
piece
of
the
title
and
then
use
with
appropriate
reference
to
the
current
idiotic
and
situation
finally
there
is
the
notion
of
that
the
title
and
the
order
was
given
and
presented
native
or
but
the
fact
that
the
new
broom
made
by
her
the
link
to
it
behol
although
if
you
would
in
was
more
ukrainian
spirit
the
dude
would
not
easily
achieved
under
his
feet
and
so
for
legal
casuistry
can
be
far
in
a
hole
to
climb

god
forbid
warm

not

january
glory
to
as
will
fit
just
curious
but
what
is
so
new
happened
today

was
still

now

the

the

not

unlike
the

in
the

oh
and
the
constitution
too
need
each
article
bold
prescribe
horde
i
forgot
ukrainian
language
in
discussing
dear
members
pleas
in
any
case
explain
just
saw
that
comment
cut

was
replaced

a
replica
of
poor
reversed
markup
i
think
it
is
clear
what
exactly
this
remark
written
in
russian
although
and
enough
sense
of
replica
and
so
understandable

why

changes
the
russian
not
write
in
ukrainian
but
here
no
this
is
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
would
add
only
that
lets
be
more

the

do
not
block

they

course
except
for

should
be
noted
that
while

can
not
