polish
historians
are
of
the
opinion
person
is
from
the
perspective
of
a
polish
historian
rating
is
simple
it
was
a
terrorist
who
was
convicted
in
the
state
of
the
attack
on
the
polish
interior
minister
to
life
imprisonment
said
dr
a
historian
dealing
with
the
history
of
relations
he
went
out
into
the
wild
just
because
they
broke
the
second
world
war
and
the
polish
authorities
before
the
germans
have
released
prisoners
however
are
looking
at
him
as
a
man
who
sat
for
free
for
many
years
first
in
polish
and
then
in
the
nazi
concentration
camp
in
as
a
result
after
the
war
in
the
us
are
able
to
present
themselves
as
victims
of
nazism
according
to
the
historian
even
by
the
standards
of
an
organization
that
practices
the
ideology
of
integral
nationalism
was
the
person
closed
to
all
forms
of
democracy
this
resulted
in
internal
divisions
in
the
flag
advocated
in
the
s
for
the
of
terrorist
activities
and
the
use
of
individual
terror
it
is
also
worth
noting
that
the
same
choice
of
victims
which
had
the
effect
of
was
not
accidental
fell
victim
to
the
is
not
the
who
have
watched
with
disgust
the
but
people
looking
for
agreement
with
them
you
can
replace
who
tried
to
create
a
bridge
of
understanding
between
poles
and
he
was
a
supporter
of
eastern
give
some
autonomy
which
fully
respected
the
rights
of
including
to
a
free
cultural
development
that
is
why
he
became
a
victim
of
oun
members
did
not
agree
to
any
compromise
solutions
seeking
to
ensure
that
before
the
was
only
one
way
uncompromising
armed
struggle
when
it
comes
to
poles
tend
to
have
the
eyes
and
eastern
and
that
are
being
committed
by
the
explains
dr
even
though
he
immediately
flag
is
not
responsible
for
the
slaughter
of
because
then
he
was
in
a
german
concentration
camp
is
undoubtedly
a
moral
responsibility
because
they
committed
crimes
created
by
the
oun
faction
whose
members
are
from
his
name
were
called
as
it
is
written
what
is
the
ratio
of
the
part
of
it
should
be
mentioned
as
it
is
by
the
poles
to
wit
it
is
quoted
above
the
current
contents
of
password
suggests
that
as
a
consequence
of
being
in
prison
for
involvement
in
the
flag
is
considered
a
hero
by
some
what
is
corruption
of
course
because
this
is
also
related
to
the
concentration
camp
it
is
also
in
this
case
to
announce
that
studies
show
that
when
it
comes
to
sympathy
the
last
place
along
with
and
this
information
should
be
placed
at
the
end
rather
than
in
the
middle
of
the
biography
as
concerns
the
assessment
of
the
present
time
another
issue
is
the
lack
of
information
about
the
perception
of
him
by
the
poles
there
seems
to
be
an
appropriate
quote
who
gave
up
it
should
also
be
mentioned
for
purposes
of
terror
which
in
the
s
drew
flag
since
his
name
was
determined
and
popularity
as
for
the
popularity
of
then
he
took
th
place
in
the
competition
people
who
created
the
besides
in
the
great
took
rd
place
and
that
as
a
result
of
fraud
what
to
the
fraction
was
established
only
in
and
from
the
flag
in
jail
so
i
beg
you
dispute
about
who
wins
and
who
does
not
does
not
belong
to
us
if
the
information
is
unreliable
remove
it
as
for
the
is
just
mean
how
big
impact
on
had
an
operation
before
his
arrest
and
after
release
and
before
being
sent
to
the
camp
therefore
you
must
clearly
write
about
this
because
the
current
password
can
not
explain
i
will
try
to
develop
and
propose
minor
changes
for
mention
of
terror
information
about
the
perception
of
it
in
and
poland
i
remind
you
that
the
password
and
not
a
place
to
conceal
the
significant
events
of
his
life
flag
terror
sounds
scary
you
will
have
to
sweat
to
prove
this
thesis
changes
in
the
article
i
propose
to
change
the
existing
ukrainian
nationalist
leader
head
of
the
national
executive
of
the
one
of
the
leaders
of

the
leader
of
the
faction
with
sometimes
a
separate
organization

is
not
a
candidate
in
the
parliamentary
elections
he
was
a
member
of
a
political
party
do
not
strive
for
a
peaceful
transfer
of
power
was
the
head
of
the
organization
which
means
the
terrorist
attacks
hit
the
state
structure
therefore
the
need
to
improve
the
existing
categories
furthermore
in
section

precisely
the
of
terrorist

the

has
many
of
poles

jews
he
is
with
the

foundation
for
the
genocide
of
polish

jewish
population

to
liberate

in
the

with
as
a
polish
citizen
under
the
name

stay
you
can
also
add
that
he
orders
notes
my
comments
on
the
proposal
was
a
leader
of
ukrainian
but
one
of
several
leaders
of
the
rest
of
the
match
he
was
a
member
of
the
illegal
but
a
functioning
political
party
you
can
add
a
category
but
that
is
entitled
and
with
the
consent
of
the
attacks
but
he
was
a
not
the
he
was
and
not
the
founder
along
with
who
the
ideological
foundation
this
is
nonsense
thats
right
he
was
living
in
etc
its
probably
enough
to
start
with
you
underestimate
the
his
name
is
called
the
branch
of
the
in
poland
as
determined
by
members
of

important
erected
a
monument
to
him
in
this
year
is
the
year
of
and
mr
sets
him
as
one
of
the
few
leaders
how
simple
here
is
my
proposal
one
of
the
main
leaders
of
the
ukrainian
the
head
of
the
national
executive
of
the

the
leader
of
the

with
sometimes
a
separate
organization
as
for
the
rest
of
the
comments
the
purpose
of
the
party
is
to
gain
power
and
the
central
nervous
system
does
not
even
try
to
gain
power
by
legal
means
in
advance
advocated
against
the
policies
of
the
agreement
undo
can
be
called
a
party
if
you
want
to
add
a
category
go
ahead
good
luck
as
for
the
organization
of
the
attacks
was
the
main
inspiration
and
principal
as
the
head
so
i
need
something
else
to
put
it
i
remind
you
that
since
i
became
chief
ek
flag
activity
gained
momentum
and
effectiveness
customer
inspiration
and
of
terrorist
actions
against
the
polish
state
and
the
soviet
union
including
attacks
in
an
official
of
the
soviet
in
and
in
the
interior
minister
of
the
second
republic
for
which
he
was
sentenced
in
to
death
to
life
imprisonment
after
the
amnesty
also
you
can
make
sentences
in
along
with
with
founded
service
which
has
a
number
of
of
poles
and
jews
in
lived
in
the
house
with
as
a
polish
citizen
under
the
name
of
stephen
this
is
not
surprising
throughout
life
beyond
childhood
when
he
was
a
citizen
of
was
polish
name
under
which
for
fear
of
the
and
lived
in
was
false
but
the
legal
also
spoke
perfect
polish
though
reasons
avoid
official
in
that
language
notes
ii
should
be
distinguished
before
the
war
was
one
of
several
leaders
of
the
since
the
leader
of
one
of
the
two
main
wanted
to
gain
power
but
starting
in
the
election
because
no
one
would
not
registered
but
on
the
basis
of
the
creation
of
the
ukrainian
population
of
certainly
he
was
a
good
and
indeed
during
his
direct
executive
action
taken
on
speed
rather
and
in
along
with
with
founded
service
do
not
exactly
know
how
many
made
the
murder
so
it
is
no
fun
in
the
exchange
anyway
for
those
interested
you
have
to
click
and
read
the
article
about
actually
lived
under
a
false
name
at
that
address
so
much
for
the
comments
flag
a
slaughter
i
think
that
you
can
not
charge
for
the
slaughter
from
september
was
in
prison
then
at
liberty
to
july
then
again
in

until
the
end

you
may
be

the
carnage

not

clearly

carefully

it

also
means
for
someone
this
fact
the
as
ukrainian
in
intended
to
exterminate
the

why
they
did
not
have

why
wait

two
years
previous

by
option
martyrdom
were
supposed
to
be

without
partisan
so
sufficient
and
and
according
to
the
same
option
ukrainian
had
use
of
such
weapons
instead
of
why
have
not
made
the
slaughter
when
they
were

i
suggest
to
change

ergo
check
his

mr

did
not

i
read
the

the

came
into
the
work

ukrainian
nationalism
of
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
the
processes
of
considerations
of
political
identity
these
are
the
works
of

ask
then
to
give
a
title
of
the

all
of
his
work
or
the
works
are
in
the

says
you
can
buy
and
find
out
how
youre
interested
this
ukrainian
source
if
they
call
themselves
ukrainian
nationalist
i

they
are
not

he
walk
up
to
the
former
ukrainian
sources
but
since
the
poles
and
claim
that
the

was
a
nationalist
is
to
mention
that
in
this

is
that
the

was

think
that
one

be

im

it
will
be
either
a
as
the

near
back
on

division
of

in

you
sat
in
but
the
beginning
of
the

with
the
germans
during
the
biggest
wave
of
killings
was
in
the
nazi
concentration
camp
of

thus
him
for
declaration
of
independence
of

course
these
events
directly
could
not
direct
but
it
prepared
the
ideological
ground
for
their
creation
the
organization
led
had
in
their
total
program
assumptions
areas
where
hundreds
of
years
poles
lived
next
door
to
the

have
never
himself
from
the
ideology
even
staying
in
the
camp
he
was
deprived
of
information
because
he
had
a
special
prisoner
status
had
contact
with
associates
located
in

you
could
say
that
his
men
murdered
poles
with

on

in
a
macabre
way

the

its

would
be
ok
what
is
important
is
who
he
says
and
what
he
says
a
is
an
expert
on
this

as
for
the
lapses
that
easily
been
forgotten
as
reported
facts

though
the

does
not
read
and
add
something
different
than
claimed
year
first
no
innuendo
i
just
look
at
the
debate
ethnic
in
eastern
it
was
presented
by
fr
several
cases
of
allegations
against

he
stubbornly

are
generally
not
a
reliable

unless
the

are
confirmed
elsewhere
in

compact
and
that
was
that
nowhere
in

does
not

not
be
used
out
of

if
it

meets
this

the

that

the

taking
part
in
the

were
minor
limited
to
a
few
cases
which
is
obviously
not
true
this
type
of

never
uses

it
is
plain

without
to

that
little
war
timeline
and
what
should
be
banned
well
again
not
true
because
unlike
you
do
not
practice
provides
quotes
and
it
was
not
a
quote
just
a
simple
statement
of

based
on
the

and
this
is

minor
limited
to
a

its

that
is
not

can
check

this
method
of
moving
the

without

call
for
oh
and
simple

please
watch
this
courier

chronicle

the
answer
as
to
whether
this
can
be
standard
source
wer
it
is
printed
on
a
standard
source
of

already
answered
you
that
this

meets
the
standards
of
and
should
be
i
do
not
know
what
you
call
about
it
according
to
the
discussion
i
put
a
that
is
necessary
in
the
sources
usual
standard
it
does
not
make
sense
is
the
source
of
this
information
rather
fit
the
of
the
confirmation
of
this

the
question
is
whether
it
is
a
please
not
to
delete
this
sentence
but
rather
look
around
for
materials
which
can
also
be
quoted
in
the
subject
line
above
a
first
there
is
another
issue
of
television
as
a
source
of
speed
in
this
case
is
a
detailed
discussion
it
is
only
a
source
that
dr
a
chaffinch
said
something
youre
kidding
said
something
he
said
something
very
important
and
as
a
historian
should
this
information
be
considered
said
the
same
thing
im
not
kidding
i
say
and
i
expect
the
source
of
facts
scientific
publications
in
print
or
electronic
a
more
interesting
examples
i
can
cite
the
opinion
of
serious
historians
in
press
statements
that
are
marked
as
hypothesis
and
also
it
is
very
important
hypothesis
eg
communist
as
an
agent
of
the
polish
police
or
george
as
a
polish
intelligence
agent
ii
branch
of
the
general
staff
but
the
hypothesis
notes
as
documentary
hypothesis
until
a
thorough
scientific
verification
thus
the
principle
of
wer
finch
hypothesis
but
does
not
express
statement
comrad
group
rating
who
is
this
and
if
we
publish
articles
every
week
talk
march
do
not
overdo
it
it
was
already
discussed
what
they
think
the
poles
pe
ukrainian
etc
but
it
is
important
to
show
what
they
think
of
the
ordinary
from
what
i
have
twice
done
research
on
this
and
came
out
the
same
result
twice
it
shows
that
the
opinion
of
is
a
constant
and
almost
clear
it
is
worth
to
mention
just
one
sentence
thats
who
it
is
it
was
worth
it
to
find
if
they
are
credible
repeal

also
used
this

probably
why

you
view
whats
the

it
has
nothing
to
do
with

we
are
interested
in
the
facts
since
anyone
taken
the

is
not
a

thats
it

you

it
btw
where

can

where

we

not

the

a

of
the

not

the

i
do
not

it
is
a
requirement
overdone
especially
when
such
controversy
i
think
you
need
a
minimum
distance

their

we
have

i
see
no

i
have
one
basic
question
i
have
a
question
in
relation
to
the
latest
edition
the
first
branches
of
the
prior
to

in

the

such
i
think
its
a
ridiculous
source
everything
has
been
given
about
in
other
the
same
position
is
the
same
the
collective
work
of
do
not
mention
the
author
why
not
just
give
the
exact
quote
in
three
to
four
relating
to
the
case
may
be
in
ukrainian
and
the
name
of
the
author
of
the
article
in
a
collective
work
not
to
create
the
impression
perhaps
mistaken
that
it
is
a
for
free
knowledge
of
content
and
without
regard
for
the
problem
can
you
ask
for
a
quote
because
it
is
exactly
that
ask
for
a
quote
the
thesis
well
corrected
according
to
the
source
i
read
it
and
i
would
suggest
reading
instead
of
from
somewhere
else
please
read
what
was
reported
as
allegedly
read
the
source
and
what
is
in
the
and
not
well
you
did
not
have
this
book
in
my
hand
i
do
not
want
to
call
it
by
name
as
you
enter
no
reading
and
catch
you
on
this
at
least
do
not
go
in
no
comment
i
resent
that
this
type
of
innuendo
but
you
will
not
have
to
have
books
are
here
is
an
excerpt
that
was
sent
to
me
this
is
further
confirmation
already
from
sources
that
flag
had
contacts
with
the
even
this
this
what
paste
summarize
sources
said
in
an
interview
contact
the
b
chaffinch
the
same
rd
word
th
ukrainian
source
writes
about
the
from
which
carried
need
i
say
more
its
not
just
the
fact
innuendo
have
not
read
the
book
on
request
you
could
not
give
her
a
description
or
a
quote
on
page
there
is
only
information
about
the
transfer
at
the
end
of
from
from
memories
and
nothing
more
then
the
flag
was
placed
under
house
arrest
in
berlin
and
not
in
give
false
give
the
statement
here
everything
has
been
given
ok
in
other
the
same
position
is
the
same
the
collective
work
of
do
not
mention
the
author
which
proves
that
you
have
not
read
the
text
which
is
and
yet
the
power
of
the
text
without
coverage
do
not
read
too
because
there
is
a
full
send
i
just
right
not
understand
the
last
two
editions
of
paul
removed
by
related
to
the
fact
that
the
flag
contacts
while
in
camp
with
s
in
default
of
the
yes
but
they
were
not
linked
by
page
and
by
the
according
to
me
where
it
says
exactly
what
removed
the
germans
were
completely
opposed
to
this
so
they
flag
to
he
kept
in
contact
with
his
and
was
finally
released
in
september
i
checked
all
the
entry
with
a
link
if
it
is
the
same
scientific
standards
as
in
the
case
of
the
relationship
cited
by
professor
ukrainian
academy
of
sciences
and
the
specific
period
of
stay
in
and
put
yourself
first
it
is
obvious
that
the
primary
source
of
information
in
such
a
case
may
only
be
a
or
companion
b
c
courier
since
the
organization
of
communication
with
the
insulator
secret
messages
in
would
be
no
mean
feat
no
one
would
be
interested
to
hide
this
fact
if
he
had
a
place
especially
since
the
content
of
the
correspondence
would
have
been
reported
after
only
if
such
a
specific
source
will
appear
repeat
i
will
introduce
them
to
the
article
as
well
as
information
today
we
do
not
have
such
a
source
to
all
is
not
a
small
group
of
boys
without
education
there
also
are
working
sometimes
they
were
ukrainian
ak
sciences
what
i
mean
is
that
it
is
not
the
source
of
a
tabloid
or
even
gw
a
scientific
institution
and
closely
related
to
the
topic
so
the
removal
of
hm
as
for
the
credibility
of
the
mere
fact
that
has
published
a
courier
does
not
automatically
give
it
a
superiority
over
other
sources
i
mean
methodology
the
same
relationship
does
not
refute
i
do
not
care
if
this
did
something
more
research
which
by
several
sources
confirmed
the
truth
of
the
relationship
thats
another
thing
example
is
extensive
work
on
and
related
unless
under
the
age
of
probably
in
any
case
a
professional
historian
in
in
a
bookstore
so
sorry
for
the
uncertainty
which
reports
from
the
period
of
the
after
v
of
the
soviet
union
reports
a
large
force
that
was
surrounded
by
the
soviet
division
subject
to
long
artillery
bombardment
and
several
that
said
according
to
a
report
by
killing
a
large
number
of
soviet
fantasy
then
he
struck
broke
the
soviet
killing
another
and
left
in
a
safe
place
without
any
losses
throughout
this
battle
each
party
war
ii
enemy
losses
his
own
but
nobody
lied
so
abysmally
stupid
way
and
this
is
not
propaganda
poster
but
the
report
having
an
command
give
you
an
idea
what
the
situation
is
and
now
if
such
a
document
or
even
publish
the
entire
it
is
to
be
credible
this
is
the
most
reliable
evidence
of
the
level
of
these
if
in
addition
to
publications
try
to
build
on
the
constructive
applications
anyway
i
do
not
know
why
the
opinions
of
russian
or
israel
would
be
worse
than
the
thesis
that
russian
scientists
are
on
the
bar
is
just
as
bad
as
that
are
not
objective
scientists
another
thing
the
fact
that
according
to
after
the
war
you
had
no
reason
to
hide
any
shares
a
connection
with
the
flag
in
the
insulator
but
on
the
contrary
should
be
proud
of
because
its
a
brilliant
success
so
if
you
do
not
speak
but
they
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
that
is
they
do
not
set
up
not
necessarily
for
example
the
establishment
of
communication
could
be
possible
thanks
to
further
cooperation
with
one
of
the
branches
of
the
etc
having
an
interest
in
the
use
of
in
case
of
problems
and
certainly
not
with
a
mind
to
calm
sentiment
flag
of
the
western
today
with
the
nazis
even
if
successful
is
not
a
reason
to
glory
so
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
reason
to
spread
the
word
so
thy
reasoning
is
not
complete
similarly
it
is
clear
that
the
primary
source
of
information
in
this
respect
can
only
be
a
the
or
his
companion
b
c
courier
not
least
the
division
the
entire
operation
as
long
as
it
was
with
the
knowledge
of
the
germans
or
the
prison
administration
if
caught
another
secret
messages
also
the
same
secret
message
if
it
is
in
the
archive
only
show
that
the
is
much
more
and
better
scientific
publications
based
on
institutions
than
on
its
own
logical
reasoning
lets
discuss
may
all
well
and
good
but
they
are
not
the
source
of
speculation
its
just
a
reference
to
thy
consideration
that
would
be
praised
contacts
with
and
if
not
praised
that
is
they
did
not
have
these
contacts
your
were
no
sources
and
were
speculative
and
that
my
comments
may
not
have
sources
by
definition
and
the
sources
i
wrote
at
the
beginning
writes
in
his
book
that
was
transferred
to
early
winter
the
winter
so
even
more
in
the
potential
not
informed
and
there
is
something
more
accurate
for
germany
with
its
flaws
but
the
records
were
accurate
writing
daily
arrival
date
even
ordinary
prisoners
much
less
special
no
one
gave
the
date
of
the
daily
monthly
because
the
beginning
of
the
winter
it
can
be
and
december
but
well
et
years
and
if
you
understand
the
customary
winter
not
even
december
could
be
not
that
it
was
great
in
itself
important
but
a
shame
that
there
is
no
precise
data
taking
into
account
that
all
the
guys
from
the
were
it
should
also
be
noted
that
btw
are
there
any
specific
sources
for
the

or
not
today
is
not

there

no

today
there
are
no

let
me
repeat
once
again
source
the
germans
were
completely
opposed
to
this
so
they
to
flag
he
kept
in
contact
with
his
and
was
finally
released
in
september
repeat
it
over
there
is
not
cause
to
disappear
otherwise
a
lot
of
things
from
to
disappear
you
can
argue
whether
it
is
the
source
of
a
sound
or
not
but
to
say
that
it
is
not
since
it
is
a
link
to
it
and
the
text
is
displayed
over
it
i
think
that
you
mean
is
that
in
the
article
no
longer
exists
if
it
is
actually
youre
right
when
he
removed
them
so
no
not
only
is
given
or
in
contact
with
those
who
were
with
him
in
the
camp
and
those
on
the
outside
this
statement
is
so
general
and
not
the
original
source
you
can
not
go
is
it
a
problem
to
find
a
source
of
scientific
fact
who
when
where
etc
btw
that
is
why
the
flag
and
were
in
because
they
were
under
the
authority
of
the
ss
not
the
which
is
a
structure
as
we
know
were
in
conflict
in
in
favor
of
ss
regard
an
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
have
the
source
and
thats
why
i
do
not
have
any
confidence
for
example
the
above
discussion
shows
how
easy
it
is
to
manipulate
the
facts
in
a
discussion
covering
them
with
nice
words
and
throw
false
accusations
reef
accused
me
of
falsification
while
put
in
the
password
text
about
the
same
as
me
so
that
i
pulled
out
of
the
other
proposals
so
far
can
not
give
an
exact
date
a
flag
in
the
camp
thus
are
more
important
than
facts
in
fact
there
are
contacts
with
the
surrounding
in
the
camp
who
listened
to
the
speech
knows
this
for
the

the

me
point
out
at
which
point
it
is
directly
written
and
who
personally
what
a
historian
in
this
statement
is
signed
with
equal
success
can
be
explained
by
the
sentence
that
was
sitting
together

in

description
introduced

mr
paul
information
here
you
can
edit
any
other
standards
than
in
the
whole
there
is
no
timeline
of
the
war
and
there
is
no
primary
source
on
the
subject
these
are
just
mr
paul
for
neutral
information
which
does
not
correspond
to
his
pov
regard
as
usual
a
lot
of
words
and
a
lot
of
accusations
few
facts
and
the
facts
are
simple
everything
about
this
position
the
integrity
and
neutrality
of
the
truth
but
i
will
ask
however
for
the
record
of
course
i
did
not
have
this
in
hand
used
the
internet
lexicon
that
a
solid
institution
and
does
not
publish
on
their
web
stuff
attempted
to
undermine
the
credibility
of
the
lexicon
that
it
was
an
online
source
one
that
does
not
stand
for
etc
it
turned
out
however
that
we
have
behind
this
great
publication
i
remember
that
we
also
had
an
interview
with
a
polish
historian
who
spoke
clearly
about
the
flag
in
contact
with
the
during
their
stay
in
the
camp
and
for
some
time
this
information
was
for
this
interview
but
unfortunately
ran
this
video
somewhere
and
then
removed
this
information
flag

was
on

there
be
no
doubt
who
is
director
of
the
historical
memory
foundations
your
vision
of
history
entered
in

in
questions
and
answers
historian
repeats
what
the
russians
have
the
rain
the
soviet
union
signed
the
pact
for
its
national
security
perhaps
they
were
brutal
but
did
not
differ
from
those
used
by
other
countries
he
explains
he
also
referred
to
the
events
of
september
when
the
soviet
union
entered
the
polish
market
when
we
talk
about
the
mission
of
liberation
that
is
the
introduction
of
soviet
troops
on
the
territories
of
western
and
western
we
have
to
understand
that
it
was
done
under
the
operating
rules
of
international
law
on
the
right
to
self
explained
in
his
opinion
there
is
no
reason
to
talk
about
violence
because
neither
france
nor
great
britain
or
even
poland
has
declared
war
after
the
soviet
union
also
writes
that
the
secret
probably
existed
when
asked
at
the
conference
about
the
source
of
knowledge
which
entered
the
brochure
said
he
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
such
documents
but
only
heard
about
them
on
the
of
russian
media
and
historians
do
not
intend
to
respond
to
the
polish
government
prime
minister
donald
tusk
said
the
government
should
not
engage
in
with
journalistic
materials
or
comments
even
as
unwise
and
unjust
as
those
that
have
would
have
acted
if
that
was
the
official
position
of
the
russian
government
he
explains
the
secret
wrote
in
his
book
presented
a
week
ago
the
pact
in
questions
and
answers
alexander
he
announced
then
that
the
documentary
evidence
of
the
truth
of
his
words
as
they
have
been
drawn
up
by

politics
collection
of

from
to
the
fact
that
the

existed
he
said
a
few
days
ago
the
same
yesterday
general
presented
the
book
reprinted
in
the
content
of
a
single
document
which
included
the
suggestion
of
the
secret

is
devoid
of

in
the
case
of
direct

indirect
attack
on
germany
poland
to
remain
neutral
so
there
is
no
question
of
a
conspiracy
directed
against
the
soviet
union
but
the
commitment
not
to
use
force
which
was
quite
apparent
in
the
agreement
whats
more
the

that
the
polish
foreign

according
to
historians
of

intelligence
was
to
be
the
of

in
an
interview
with
french
opposed

a

investigate
the
matter

respond
officially
claims
that
any
aggression
against
poland
and
it
was
not
as

historians
only
talks
about
the
liberation
of
western
and
if
we
talk
about
the
march
of

the
entry
of
soviet
troops
into

we
must
understand
that
these
actions
were
in
line
with
international
standards
with
the
right
to
says
and
other
actions
such
as
deprivation
of
