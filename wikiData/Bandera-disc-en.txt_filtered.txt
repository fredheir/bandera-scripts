about
the
acts
of
the
headed
by
in
the
following
article
written
by
an
eyewitness
a
survivor
the
relevant
paragraph
from
this
site
is
the
following
ukrainian
general
in
the
soviet
army
who
to
the
german
side
along
with
his
entire
army
his
troops
fought
against
the
russians
on
the
front
and
were
very
active
in
the
murder
of
jews
in
the
and
in
russia
and
his
men
went
underground
prior
to
the
german
downfall
well
armed
by
the
germans
he
continued
his
fight
against
the
russians
and
his
killing
of
jews
and
poles
for
several
years
after
the
allied
victory
i
could
ascertain
during
my
trip
to
the
that
today
is
considered
a
national
hero
all
the
towns
have
streets
and
named
after
him
and
there
are
many
dedicated
to
him
he
is
almost
at
the
same
level
as
two
other
ukrainian
heroes
with
jewish
blood
on
their
hands
and
comment
by
pan
no
soviet
general
cannot
possibly
be
correct
this
is
probably
caused
by
a
confusion
with
someone
else
perhaps
was
on
the
german
side
when
they
but
was
soon
arrested
for
being
too
independent
he
even
opposed
the
formation
of
but
a
lot
of
atrocities
were
committed
by
his
supporters
in
his
name
and
never
them
or
asked
for
forgiveness
it
is
also
true
that
someone
in
whose
name
so
many
innocent
people
jews
poles
and
yes
relatives
of
communist
partisans
were
killed
should
not
be
so
popular
in
well
it
is
a
difficult
and
controversial
question
and
one
has
to
be
respectful
of
the
thousands
of
innocent
victims
of
the
ukrainian
radical
nationalism
but
there
is
another
problem
to
bear
in
mind
was
one
of
several
millions
ukrainian
people
who
the
turmoil
of
history
with
its
violence
and
oppression
his
fight
for
liberation
of
his
people
against
the
polish
soviet
and
t
imprisonment
in
concentration
camp
i
think
that
this
part
has
to
be
since
has
been
held
at
special
section
of
for
important
prisoners

his

ideas

about

are
very
similar
with

a
very
poor
attempt
at
putting
in
false
information
into
a
article
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the

if
he
were
after
the

at
the
end
of
june
and
before
the
arrival
of
german
forces
on

local
ukrainian
murdered
certain
jewish
individuals
who
had
been
active
in
the
soviet
administration
ukrainian
attacked
jews
in
what
was
in
part
a
militia
riot
in
part
a
pogrom
property
and
some
jews
into
forced
labour
in
the
town
the
violence
in
was
directed
by
a
ukrainian
doubtless
inspired
by
the
militant
and
of
the
organization
for
ukrainian
of
according
to
their
aggressive
and
angry
nationalist
ideology
jews
were
as
of
communism
and
as
of
poland
and
soviet
russia
in
the
oppression
suffered
by
yet
the
ukrainian
was
merely
a
prelude
to
the
catastrophe
that
was
soon
to
unfold
when
the
german
forces
arrived
they
were
followed
in
their
wake
by
the
special
action
groups
the
extermination
every
attack
involving
jews
is
usually
a
pogrom
it
is
an
term
its
nice
to
blame
the
actions
of
a
on
an
organization
but
where
is
the
proof
words
such
as
doubtless
are
quite
doubtful
in
this
case
the
has
not
been
proven
to
be
in
fact
many
of
the
leaders
were
either
jewish
or
married
to
jews
ie
richard
the
jews
mentioned
were
not
attacked
because
they
were
jewish
but
because
of
their
actions
during
he
sovie
occupation
of
western
regarding
wel
became
chief
of
the
third
foreign
armies
east
on
april
he
was
thus
responsible
for
military
intelligence
operations
throughout
eastern
europe
and
the
soviet
union
his
was
connected
in
this
role
with
a
number
of
secret
fascist
organizations
in
the
countries
to
east
these
included
b
faction
of
the
organization
of
ukrainian
iron
guard
the
of
yugoslavia
the
of
latvia
and
after
the
summer
of
army
the
band
of
from
soviet
communism
marching
behind
former
red

general
later
on

placed
one

his
top
men
in

his
power
and
then
after

was

his

by
the

became
in

chief
wel
this
agitation
leaflet
calling
on
killing
jews
poles
and
russian
where
is
it
i
would
really
like
to
see
a
copy
of
it
because
i
do
not
believe
that
it
exists
if
it
did
it
would
be
widely
available
and
quite
sensational
regarding
the
declaration
of
independence
numerous
books
have
been
published
which
have
shed
light
on
these
events
in
particular
i
recall
books
vid
do
and
a
number
of
others
was
one
of
the
members
elected
to
a
position
in
that
attempt
to
establish
a
ukrainian
government
he
was
very
critical
of
and
and
published
all
the
documents
of
that
day
pointing
out
attempts
to
doctor
them
after
the
fact
by
the
faction
he
was
very
critical
of
this
i
remember
in
his
book
pointing
out
that
in
the
original
it
was
written
that
the
ukrainian
state
was
established
not
as
they
often
publish
even
today
o
i
wouldnt
think
that
you
would
but
a
link
to
any
publication
or
site
that
has
printed
it
would
be
a
nice
start
regarding
active
with
the
nazis
i
am
shocked
by
how
the
and
the
nazis
to
divide
up
poland
in
the
secret
pact
i
am
shocked
that
the
nazis
and
the
together
and
celebrated
the
destruction
of
poland
in
photos
and
documents
which
continue
to
be
primarily
by
and
polish
scholars
these
materials
are
based
on
documents
your
statements
are
based
on
hearsay
regarding
the
faction
of
which
i
am
not
a
member
btw
i
am
disappointed
that
they
have
documents
rather
than
explain
their
actions
and
within
the
historic
context
of
the
times
but
i
am
not
surprised
either
one
needs
to
remember
that
the
nazis
at
that
time
did
not
have
a
negative
track
record
and
in
western
which
up
till
was
part
of
the
german
speaking
regime
of
the
treated
the
much
better
than
the
poles
and
then
you
have
the
brutal
soviet
regime
with
its
censorship
and
terror
in
the
brief
years
the

in

one

some

you

by

a

you
kept
this

from
an

also
declared
that

and
the

in
the
thanks
to
providing
an
excellent

by
we
now
see
that
the
conference
not
only
stated
the
above

also
condemned
because
they
attention

the

ukrainian

did

march
german

concluded
that
ukrainian
were
indifferent
to
the
plight
of
the

were
willing

either

added
why
a

o
please
clarify
conclusion
that
you
object
to
has
two
parts
the
first
is
that
played
a
central
role
in
russian
hungarian
and
romanian
do
you
consider
this
part
s
nope
because
the
early
to
mid
th
century
polish
nationalism
did
not
have
as
its
core
such
a
generalization
is
just
not
true
the
article
at
the
moment
says
that
the
ukrainian
saw
the
russians
and
the
poles
as
the
chief
enemy
not
jews
well
it
was
much
the
same
with
the
polish
their
chief
enemy
were
the
germans
at
the
moment
we
have
a
paradox
that
the
who
did
not
collaborate
with
nazi
germany
and
who
did
not
participate
in
of
jews
a
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
fact
that
wasnt
a
core
part
of
the
ukrainian
nationalist
program
in
his
book
the
jewish
paradox
p
write
before
the
war
i
was
in
touch
with
the
polish
government
which
made
no
bones
of
its
and
in
particular
its
foreign
minister
joseph
beck
when
i
told
him
that
poland
ought
to
grant
its
jews
greater
economic
freedom
his
reply
was
cynical
on
the
contrary
we
are
actually
thinking
of
maybe
the
equivalent
of
the
laws
and
he
explained
it
as
follows
we
need
foreign
currency
writes
it
has
also
become
more
difficult
to
maintain
the
innocence
of
ukrainian
national
ideology
in
light
of
recent
research
it
is
now
clear
that
ukrainian
nationalism
in
was
already
highly
in
the
late
th
century
and
had
developed
an
elaborate
discourse
articles
appeared
regularly
in
the
western
ukrainian
press
during
the
war
oun
leader
expressed
his
support
for
war
criminality
a
blank
spot
in
the
collective
memory
of
the
ukrainian
the
cited
article
is
from
both
of
the
oun
were
themselves
and
wartime
documents
with
regard
to
leading
show
that
during
the
german
invasion
they
wanted
the
jews
or
at
the
very
least
jewish
males
killed
and
that
they
were
willing
to
participate
in
the
process
the
propaganda
chief
openly
endorsed
the
german
methods
against
the
jews
ukrainian
usually
support
their
claim
that
the
was
not
by
pointing
to
the
fact
that
the
organization
had
jewish
doctors
in
its
ranks
however
they
fail
to
state
that
these
same
doctors
were
eliminated
by
the
once
the
germans
retreated
from
with
the
advance
of
the
red
army
jewish
were
obviously
not
all
of
them
were
murdered
does
mention
anything
about
it

is
given

of

in

those

to

foreign
influence
particularly
the
german
racist
concepts
and
practices
friedman
noted
a
claim
by
two
sources
first
by
a
woman
whose
surname
began
with
e
i
dont
have
book
and
probably
wont
have
time
to
go
to
university
library
for
awhile
but
noted
that
there
were
no
details
to
the
first
claim
and
that
the
second
claim
was
mistaken
specifically
he
wrote
that
a
claim
that
jews
were
killed
by
when
the
advanced
was
mistaken
because
in
reality
it
was
not
a
soviet
advance
but
a
german
one
and
the
jews
did
not
escape
in
time
friedman
did
note
that
he
personally
met
several
jews
who
had
been
saved
by
and
lived
in
israel
after
the
war
one
has
to
twist
work
in
order
to
use
it
to
support
the
claim
that
killed
its
jewish
personnel
read
note
here
as
for
as
noted
he
did
not
deny
that
ukrainian
nationalism
included
rather
that
wasnt
a
core
aspect
of
its
program
and
that
jews
were
never
seen
as
the
principal
or
even
a
principal
enemy
there
was
no
belief
in
an
jewish
conspiracy
and
that
these
facts
ukrainian
nationalism
from
that
of
its
polish
russian
hungarian
and
romanian
neighbors
conclusion
was
that
the
relationship
ukrainian
and
jews
was
ambiguous
and
in
my
opinion
for
the
purposes
of
this
article
a
brief
conclusion
is
probably
while
a
more
detailed
description
may
belong
in
the
oun
article
the
examples
of
you
cite
above
mostly
came
from
the
period
when
the
oun
was
still
with
the
germans
in
accordance
with
conclusion
the
oun
was
certainly
willing
to
kill
jews
if
that
were
the
price
for
a
beneficial
alliance
with
germany
and
the
propaganda
mostly
from
to
supports
this
assertion
but
it
was
not
an
end
in
itself
and
otherwise
the
oun
was
willing
to
help
jews
was
temporary
and
strategic
rather
than
a
part
of
programme
the
you
quoted
support
this
too
both
of
the
oun
were
themselves
and
wartime
documents
with
regard
to
leading
show
that
during
the
german
invasion
they
wanted
the
jews
or
at
the
very
least
jewish
males
killed
and
that
they
were
willing
to
participate
in
the
process
i
still
hero
of
yes
well
he
might
be
a
hero
of
until
may
day
but
that
makes
him
no
more
hero
of
than
other
war
serial
and
genocide
well
a
nazi
who
killed
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
is
presented
here
as
a
heroic
patriot
and
an
example
for
young
to
follow
i
think
that
just
one
sentence
about
mass
murder
activity
is
some
kind
of
absurd
and
that
this
demands
at
least
one
extra
independent
where
one
could
find
some
neutral
and
truthful
its
not
that
and
all
the
nazis
are
evil
ok
and
dont
get
me
wrong
im
no
communist
im
a
nationalist
myself
but
i
hate
nazism
so
much
as
i
am
a
pole
only
truth
shall
set
you
free
time
to
get
this
people
th
response
to
nazis
in
this
piece
of
information
is
especially
dubious
in
was
asked
by
nazi
officers
whether
he
would
support
or
not
according
to
one
source
quickly
replied
that
it
was
clear
that
the
nazis
would
lose
the
war
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
for
by
siding
with
them
if
there
any
other
sources
that
could
confirm
that
i
mean
the
response
no
to
such
question
about
answered
by
prisoner
in
concentration
camp
should
have
lead
to
gas
chamber
for
sure
i
doubt
this
had
place
in
reality
activities
of
oun
and
with
nazis
that
followed
were
very
intense
people
were
trained
ammunition
was
supplied
joint
actions
were
if
thought
that
nazis
would
loose
then
why
this
intense
cooperation
followed
picture
candidates
no
no
should
one
of
this
pictures
be
added
to
the
article
since
they
say
something
about
his
present
popularity
or
not
and
these
are
just
exceptions
i
relations
with
nazi
germany

listed
in
with
incorrect
to
try
to
fix

errors
one
of
the
things
i
do
is
look
for
content
for
references
in
articles
i
have
found
content
for
some
of
the
problem
is
that
i
found
more
than
one
version
i
cant
determine
which
if
any
is
correct
for
this
article
so
i
am
asking
for
a
sentient
editor
to
look
it
over
and
copy
the
correct
content
