moreover
you

knowing
how
to

the

professor
an
this

was
in

before
so
it
does
not

to
me
you
can
not
use
your

away

i
ask
for
the
third

well
my
dear
sir
i
only
said
the

and
gave
the
ai
it
can
be
argued
whether
the

of

on

not
be
on
the

of
ai
as
the
man
clearly
was
not
himself
and
was
not
responsible
for
his
words
we
read
what
he
writes
in
the

from
the

evaluative
that
does
not
shine
through
however
we
argue
about
anything
beware
of
false
authority
do
not
trust
statements
about
the
credibility
of
a
source
degrees
mean
prestige
only
to
the
area
in
which
they
were
received
and
even
that
please
take
the
trouble
to
read
the
third
paragraph
from
april
to
discuss
read
i
look
at
the

of

to
the

you
removed
the

to
added
that
it
deals
with
the

does
not
make
it

not
true
look
closely
yes
you
are
right
please
forgive
me
for
carelessness
however
accepted
the
fact
that
the
second

is
in
no
way
contrary
to
the
first
but
complements

it
because
in

i
put
both
i
do
not
you
think
that
this
is
somewhat
incorrect
to
speak
that
way
about

i
do
not
like
to
get
personal
but
to
claim
the

be
nice
to
yourself
at

is
also

yes
to
this
i
replied
to
you
already
too

i

you
also
need
to
respect
the

if
there

wonder
who

his

of
this

you
took
his

what
gives
you
the
right
to
make

about
the

of
knowledge
of
the
person
with
whom
you
probably
do
not
even
know
personally
outcome
of
the

i
watch
the

respects

any

was

watch

if
you

it

no

can
be

a

in
this

for
the
sake
of

could
be

information
on
the
origins
of
the

not
for
no
reason
took
up
the
repression
of
ethnic

it
is
necessary
to
point
out
that
the
conflict
has
deep
historical
roots
is
centuries
old
reason
for
it
was
the
centenary
feud
between
the
ukrainian
people
was
under
the
rule
of
poland
and
the

the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century

of
the
ukrainian
population

there

august
of
course
any
information
would
be
superfluous
following
a
modular
i
believe
that
this

is
best
to
give
a
separate
item
from
these
considerations
added
a
red
link
to

august
the
concept
of
massacre
in
my
opinion
somewhat
we
need
to
create
an
article
about
the
events
people
died
a
fact
significant
however
more
be
called
an

like
this
ethnic

if
that
or
the
other
actually
it
was
the
ethnic

addition
as
revenge
for
the
subsequent
ethnic
of
in
poland
which
had
been
previously
august
i
have
no
opinion
on
the
matter
the
expression
massacre
is
taken
from
the
bbc
russian
service
reports
referred
to

apparently

not

if
you
take
a
closer
look
at
the
section
and
contemporary
public
opinion
you
will
find
the
same
thing
in
poland
as
the
fighter
of
the

remember
that
the

not
dump

blow
provocative
visit

before
placing

the

the

is
a
clear
bias
from
negative

positive
january
and
if
this
is
a

cheat
the

that
best
the

the

january
can
you
explain
the
reason
why
you
are
the
part
of
the

gleb
january
what
relation
to
the
subject
of
the

has
to
pass
fail
in
the
second
round
and
that
means
one
of
the
last
decree
if
after
he
had
signed
more
than
a
dozen
also
in
the
text
is
the
pressure
the
lack
of
ukrainian
but
to
dignify
him
this
honor
a
few
people
not
as
citizens
of
and
signed
a
decree
as
the
first
of
his
presidency
and
therefore
neutral
description
of
the

is
more
appropriate
in
this

january
the

condemned
the

question
in

the

pr
need
this

do
not
be
limited
to
simple
fact
the
first
second
paragraph
before
has
caused
extremely
controversial
both
in
and
abroad
point
and
who
himself
as
leave
for
newspaper
these
are
all
the
people
who
acted
and
spoke
they
are
significant
for
this
article
and
campaign
they
only
delight
the
ears
of
his
pour
each
his
own
i
am
absolutely
sure
that
after
some
time
these
details
will
be
removed
for
and
historical
subject
of
the
article
so
do
not
do
it
right
away
and
not
to
make
a
long
flood
and
war
in
a
vacuum
how
do
you
feel
january
all
of
these
people
and
organizations
are
significant
in
addition
it
is
important
to
understand
the
role
of
in
the
and
in
the
world
no
it
is
not
an
empty
statement
though
it
too
sometimes
this
is
an
important
issue
for
especially
for
those
who
are
here
in
along
with
name
and
central
streets
named
and
then
later
will
ask
what
is
there
started
yes
thats
about
it
january
two
more
times
read
here
about
the
inside
and
outside
showdown
between
the
actions
of
politicians
but
adds
nothing
to
the
article
titled
a
more
convinced
that
this
article
this
piece
urgent
need
to
remove
does
not
stand
january
do
not
delete
the
course
and
then
make
a
separate
article
as
more
or
make
a
down
january
i
believe
that
the
subject
eventually
burn
out
but
the
fact
is
that
in
dominated
by
negative
or
neutral
reaction
is
probably
possible
to
ascertain
so
after
some
time
the
section
can
be
reduced
in
particular
by
the
urgent
publication
of
the
judgment
and
order
with
time
everything
will
be
and
quotes
relegate
to
or
refer
to
the
original
sources
january
i
would
not
say
that
in
all
positive
negative
no
less
january
in
there
are
both
positive
and
negative
and
neutral
in
is
positive
enough
but
a
lot
of
neutral
aside
from
the
poles
jews
and
russia
january
condemned
the
recognition
of
hero
of
partition
is
required
even
if
some
of
the
politicians
and
other
people
whose
opinions
are
as
presented
and
then
pour
delight
the
ears
of
voters
readers
viewers
etc
this
that
in
and
abroad
so
full
of
people
that
are
nice
to
hear
accusations
towards
which
is
in
turn
related
to
the
demonstration
of
his
personality
moreover
the
views
show
who
and
what
belongs
to
in
and
would
not
you
say
a
hero
he
fought
for
the
independence
of
and
fought
with
the
and
the
and
it
deserves
a
lot
of
respect

february
recently
found
an
article
on
one
of
the
sites
where
the
author
states
that
the
glorification
of
and
the
in
modern
principles
on
which
the
modern
ukrainian
state
ie
have
headed
to
a
state
with
a
totalitarian
regime
and
the
modern
a
democratic
state
where
there
is
no
mandatory
ideology
and
all
regardless
of
nationality
of
its
citizens
and
he
wondered
why
in
he
and
awarded
the
title
of
hero
of
if
their
ideological
views
contrary
to
constitutional
principles
because
this
title
should
be
awarded
one
who
or
strengthen
them
or
whose
activities
it
does
not
that
heroes
of
freedom
and
our
head
of
have
similar
political
views
need
electorate
in
western
as
the
head
of
the

after
the
termination

now
he

february
i
suggest
you
read
the
rules
of

and
delete
the

along
with
the

anonymous
because
they
do
not
have
to
do

since

just
a
crazy
amount
then
the

you
have

cool
april
well
it
all
fell
into
place
is
no
longer
a

ukrainian

the
heroism
of
can
the
court
annul
the
of
the
president

a
separate
conversation
in
any
case
the
decision
shall
take
effect
no
earlier
than
days
after
the
decision
so
that
a
change
in
the
present
text
is
april
youre
crazy
there
is
quite
a
significant
fact
and
take
it
to
the
effect
or
not
but
it
would
still
be
ample
significant
fact
april
and
where
it
says
that
the
court
shall
enter
into
force
days
andrew

in

april
in
part
of

of
the
code
resolved
court
not
code
silica
line
about
code
not
said
filed
that
is
days
and
then
if
declared
not

and
if
you
will
be
served
while
it
appeals
court
will
consider
and
there
is
the
court
in
is
the
decision
into
effect
are
not
yet
known
and
will
take
it
and
according
to
this
deprive
award
is
premature
it
would
be
logical
to
make
appropriate
changes
to
the
article
after
the
decision
will
be
approved
and
will
come
into
force
april
and
the
appeal
will
be
filed
april
the
question
of
appeal
is
likely
to
be
decided
in
the
light
of
political
solution
to
the
current
leadership
however
the
historical
aspect
will
always
be
split
the
recognition
of
the
current
political
power
and
historical
fact
the
evaluation
of
which
is
unlikely
to
be
unique
april
article
defended
with
option
without
reward
at
the
moment
the
presidential
decree
on
remains
in
force
as
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
force
did
not
come
appeal
on
the
application
will
be
filed
in
consideration
appellate
court
will
take
time
one
can
assume
that
after
the
approval
of
the
court
of
appeal
decision
the
decision
will
be
to
the
supreme
administrative
court
this
is
going
to
take
time
the
solution
that
the
courts
will
make
a
second
and
third
instance
is
not
known
perhaps
the
decision
of
the
district
court
will
be
reversed
and
the
changes
already
made
in
the
article
maybe
it
makes
sense
to
return
information
about
the
award
in
place
until
the
decree
will
cease
to
exist
as
it
is
required
by
law
april
quoted
by
basically
i
was
expecting
something
like
that
but
i
want
to
draw
attention
to
two
points
first
decree
is
an
act
of
individual
action
the
title
hero
of
to
to
the
late
the
rights
freedoms
and
interests
of
not
affect
the
rights
freedoms
and
interests
of
third
parties
including
lawyer
in
this
particular
case
the
plaintiff
may
be
claims
on
the
acts
of
individual
action
under
part
of
art
are
treated
in
the
community
host
location
of
the
plaintiff
that
is
it
turns
out
either
in
the
place
of
residence
or
in
the
at
the
location
as
far
as
i
know
neither
there
nor
there
ukrainian
administrative
courts
to
be
established
second
if
at
some
hangover
considered
decree
as
a
legal
act
the
lawyer
still
a
very
big
stretch
will
be
the
plaintiff
however
in
this
case
according
to
part
it
should
consider
the
court
jurisdiction
over
the
city
of
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
courts
consider
claims
lawyer
against
central
government
a
similar
case
was
in
the
early
this
clearly
indicates
that
in
light
of
recent
political
changes
this
group
of
cases
will
now
be
considered
by
the
district
court
jurisdiction
over
the
city
of
apparently
the
code
just
stupidly
forgot
to
make
the
appropriate
changes
my
the
decision
to
is
canceled
for
formal
reasons
after
in
addition
the
quote
by
pc
create
an
interesting
precedent
canceled
title
as
a
person
who
died
before
can
not
be
citizens
of
and
the
claim
to
the
president
to
award
the
title
of
hero
of
to
satisfy
the
decree
as
unlawful
and
cancel
it
for
the
same
reason
we
must
now
deny
the
title
of
all
who
died
before
for
example
or
here
april
your
analyst
is
not
in
place
there
is
not
a
forum
see
above
warning
april
the
question
was
by
far
neither
the
who
are
not
deprived
why
have
removed
information
about
the
award
of
the
current
version
of
the
article
and
defended
the
article
in
this
form
where
the
discussion
april
stable
version
contains
award
its
not
to
resolved
through
discussion
april
and
what
have
the
stable
version
were
discussing
the
current
april
a
quite
the
place
strange
quotes
arguments
led
to
the
fact
that
it
is
too
early
to
make
changes
to
the
article
so
much
so
that
changes
restore
information
about
the
award
participants
give
an
estimate
of
the
of
the
president
are
legitimate
or
not
thats
where
the
analyst
april
said
it
was
an
event
the
court
must
be
by
an
article
by
a
court
to
add
a
response
to
this
decision
appeal
it
was
my
constructive
suggestion
here
without
about
the
court
added
thanks
of
appeal
not
yet
april
ill
tell
you
a
secret
only
you
or
who
do
not
speak
until
the
decision
of
the
court
has
not
entered
into
force
with
the
legal
aspect
of
the
event
and
there
can
not
be
explain
the
fingers
if
you
divorce
with
his
wife
and
the
district
court
ruled
that
your
car
leaves
your
wife
it
does
not
mean
that
the
car
is
hers
youll
use
this
machine
as
long
as
the
decision
of
the
district
court
does
not
approve
the
regional
court
and
then
the
supreme
so
see
ill
tell
you
more
recently
lost
its
credibility
and
become
a
laughing
stock
out
of
it
for
just
such
decisions
you
read
the
comments
to
news
professionals
in
the
part
where
the
questions
are
references
to
this
resource
the
issue
of
objectivity
is
not
worth
it
there
is
a
question
about
elementary
correspond
to
reality
and
to
me
to
be
honest
its
sad
to
realize
as
i
have
the
knowledge
and
experience
here
too
april
innuendo
not
filled
with
card
is
not
greatly
reduce
the
authority
of
as
those
cases
when
told
outright
lies
or
information
ukrainian
navy
in
the
article
there
is
a
whole
section
on
prizes
relative
in
the
card
i
find
it
necessary
to
return
to
the
as
the
decision
of
the
court
has
not
yet
entered
into
force
and
may
be
and
as
if
we
do
not
take
it
more
rewarding
to
at
least
the
number
of
the
card
should
be
a
reward
generous
april
the
thing
is
that
removed
from
the
award
although
today
the
decision
of
the
court
is
not
in
force
that
is
even
hero
april
the
supreme
administrative
court
of
on
august
confirmed
the
decision
according
to
which
the
title
of
hero
of
ukrainian
nationalist
leader
was
given
illegally
in
addition
the
court
made
a
similar
decision
in
respect
of
another
leader
of
ukrainian
roman
i
draw
your
attention
editing
an
article
on
this
topic
it
violated
the
style
of
presentation
between
the
third
and
fourth
clearly
something
missing
some
illogical
gap
usually
in
the
encyclopedia
article
the
key
concept
the
acronym
the
person
the
first
time
in
the
text
here
in
the
text
can
not
immediately
understand
what
who
is
miller
april
nationalist
whether
the
organization
of
ukrainian
i
think
that
this
topic
should
be
closed
once
and
for
all
so
as
not
to
give
rise
to
such
my
actions
are
no
better
because
i
just
do
not
know
how
to
explain
party
that
oil
oil
not
wet
june
i
propose
to
write
a
more
neutral
ukrainian
politician
as
in
the
i
think
that
then
the
question
will
definitely
be
closed
june
such
things
cloud
in
trousers
probably
so
and
will
have
to
do
otherwise
the
war
will
never
run
out
of
june
early
in
the
topic
covered
it
is
not
necessary
to
manipulate
concepts
the
nationalist
not
preclude
national
liberation
by
all
as
if
it
was
not
someone
uncomfortable
the
nationalist
movement
in
the
in
the
century
was
of
nationalistic
character
since
the
main
aim
was
to
create
an
independent
nation
state
june
rights
the
problem
rather
is
that
in
fact
supporters
of
the
oun
there
is
definitely
a
positive
attitude
to
this
organization
and
propaganda
remained
educated
belief
that
national
liberation
thats
good
belonging
to
the
national
liberation
as
it
gives
absolution
inherent
in
any
international
conflicts
to
make
national
liberation
forces
and
clearly
the
villain
of
the
oppressor
it
is
the
one
with
whom
fighting
national
liberation
movements
june
what
is
life
manipulation
concepts
there
anonymous
tried
to
insert
a
national
movement
and
as
if
this
was
not
someone
uncomfortable
and
it
was
so
whether
this
is
a
national
liberation
or
can
inscribe
both
and
so
it
is
absolutely
yours
and
ours
june
in
fact
in
case
of
problems
with
a
capacious
term
should
give
a
more
detailed
definition
the

is
to

no
argument
the
main
condition
of

in

it
is
not
the

the

relief

as

as

identification

some
technical

certainly
can
not

argument

not
enough
to

to
the

the

authorities
oun
passed
to
the
armed
confrontation
in
the
struggle
for
control
over
territories
that
oun
believed
ukrainian
bad
enough
that
the
text
is
a
link
to
an
article
oun
which
you
can
write
all
of
the
above
if
it
is
not
written
june
be
that
as
it
may
the
term
national
liberation
for
residents
is
pronounced
positive
color
and
for
the
population
to
apply
it
to
similarly
the
term
nationalist
has
a
pronounced
negative
coloration
and
unacceptable
for
another
part
of
the
population
so
can
still
write
ukrainian
politicians
and
stop
this
war
of
june
the
expression
national
liberation
is
a
pronounced
positive
color
for
most
people
around
the
world
nationalist
has
a
pronounced
negative
coloration
on
the
other
side
people
who
brought
about
a
particular
program
often
based
on
the
substitution
of
the
concepts
of
nationalism
and
nazis
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
national
liberation
movements
were
nationalist
for
example
comrade
ho
chi
minh
was
a
typical
nationalist
but
he
was
a
nationalist
good
because
of
our
this
is
the
question
all
sorts
of
color
concepts
so
lets
build
on
the
objective
reality
and
not
on
political
and
value
of
the
kingdom
of
kuwait
or
june
expression
nationalistic
is
a
pronounced
negative
coloration
and
unacceptable
for
another
part
of
the
population
this
argument
can
not
be
taken
seriously
given
the
name
of
the
organization
led
by
and
that
this
name
should
be
in
the
text
immediately
after
the
discussion
of
expression
activity
involved
several
more
activity
than
nationalism
june
nationalism
is
not
the
sphere
of
activity
and
ideology
june
ukrainian
politicians
upon
reflection
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
statement
can
not
be
accepted
the
reason
is
simple
the
subject
of
a
page
that
it
was
and
extends
the
scope
of
its
interests
in
yet
had
no
ukrainian
and
the
polish
and
german
accordingly
we
have
this
statement
polish
and
german
politician
leader
of
the
ukrainian
nationalist
movement
june
the
expression
the
ukrainian
politician
applies
to
the
great
russian
encyclopedia
one
of
the
most
authoritative
source
well
the
polish
and
german
is
generally
ad
june
the
problem
is
that
confuses
german
german
russian
and
the
russian
and
are
different
but
the
ukrainian
ethnic
and
ukrainian
as
citizens
do
not
differ
was
a
ukrainian
ethnic
but
never
was
a
ukrainian
by
nationality
this
issue
was
raised
in
one
day
filling
about
it
if
he
was
a
citizen
of
the
the
only
one
that
he
announced
a
couple
of
days
in
in
documents
proving
his
he
was
polish
and
then
german
thats
why
from
the
point
of
view
he
was
a
legal
person
which
until
had
clearly
poland
carried
out
its
activities
in
the
poland
after
the
band
comes
some
uncertainty
poland
that
from
to
its
sovereign
territory
was
occupied
by
the
and
only
in
at
the
conclusion
of
a
treaty
on
the
border
of
poland
recognized
affiliation
receiving
a
back
part
of
the
territory
called
the
soviet
and
a
rare
event
in
our
times
ukrainian
side
view
is
different
in
efforts
of
the
pact
and
the
red
army
was
with
the
main
and
since
the
territory
in
which
the
war
or
anyone
wire
genocide
the
of
poland
engaged
in
political
struggle
some
members
of
the
ukrainian
side
ukrainian
as
they
called
themselves
were
the
ukrainian
lands
whats
more
a
number
of
areas
of
postwar
poland
which
was
carried
out
action
many
in
believe
ukrainian
and
which
held
both
the
fighting
and
other
forms
of
in
terms
of
law
are
to
this
day
in
poland
thus
it
appears
that
a
polish
citizen
being
until
operated
in
its
territory
from
to
he
directed
the
activities
of
his
organization
which
was
distributed
in
the
soviet
union
occupied
poland
and
after
the
war
his
organization
operated
in
the
soviet
union
and
poland
after
became
a
citizen
of
germany
as
you
may
have
noticed
as
a
subject
of
international
law
at
the
time
did
not
exist
and
therefore
was
only
polish
and
german
june
the
problem
is
that
uses
approach
yes
the
logic
he
can
present
arguments
that
polish
politician
but
in
the
real
world
no
one
scientist
even
can
not
think
to
call
him
so
june
the
problem
is
that
an
alternative
legal
approach
which
you
called
formal
logical
only
ideological
approach
but
as
soon
as
we
set
foot
on
this
slippery
path
we
can
not
stand
up
that
is
to
find
any
common
ground
with
the
reality
on
the
other
june
only
one
alternative
the
use
of
the
most
authoritative
sources
do
you
have
sources
that
polish
politician
june
im
talking
about
the
actual
situation
not
about
what
we
are
taught
authoritative
and
other
miscellaneous
sources
the
expression
politician
definitely
not
associated
with
but
with
nationality
that
is
why
we
need
to
avoid
the
term
ukrainian
politicians
it
is
an
elementary
mistake
as
regards
the
concept
of
the
most
authoritative
sources
it
is
strange
as
if
we
have
the
right
rank
vote
authoritative
source
select
and
present
article
concept
is
different
first
of
all
explain
exactly
known
facts
and
their
interpretation
in
the
second
indicating
that
this
interpretation
the
fact
that
was
first
polish
citizen
a
citizen
of
germany
and
then
someone
challenged
june
the
concept
of
using
the
most
authoritative
sources
directly
follows
from
the
ep
weight
and
vp
june
read
the
rules
carefully
please
concerns
the
use
of
authoritative
sources
a
threshold
of
credibility
and
the
reduction
of
their
points
of
view
to
the
general
and
not
about
cutting
off
all
points
of
view
apart
from
the
point
of
view
of
one
the
most
trustworthy
source
june
in
this
case
we
are
not
discussing
the
content
of
the
article
which
actually
might
be
represented
authoritative
point
of
view
as
a
preamble
the
amount
of
which
is
not
infinite
and
you
still
have
not
answered
the
question
about
the
ai
polish
watered
figure
june
of
course
the
preamble
can
not
accommodate
all
the
different
points
of
view
so
the
controversial
provisions
in
it
is
better
not
to
mention
only
indisputable
facts
what
nationality
is
determined
by
the
nationality
of
the
politician
the
ai
not
require
as
a
fact
june
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
is
that
since
it
does
not
describe
the
ai
see
june
the
situation
looks
like
this
is
a
ukrainian
nationalist
which
operates
mainly
in
poland
and
the
soviet
union
including
during
the
german
occupation
of
the
territories
of
these
countries
which
is
now
mostly
part
of
he
had
the
nationality
of
poland
and
germany
the
same
with
nationalist
he
should
conduct
their
activities
mainly
in
turkey
he
is
a
turkish
national
whose
prison
and
sits
as
i
remember
was
in
the
polish
prison
sentence
for
the
polish
court
june
here
i
am
talking
about
the
same
thing
we
do
not
write
that
turkish
politician
june
the
same
problem
turkish
ethnic
and
turkish
turkish
owned
do
not
differ
it
would
be
to
say
that
is
a
nationalist
operating
primarily
in
turkey
june
quite
right
ukrainian
nationalist
actually
with
this
and
start
a
discussion
june
colleagues
i
will
try
to
express
their
opinion
can
somehow
get
closer
positions
nationalism
and
the
nationalist
movement
as
a
characteristic
of
the
ideology
bears
no
negative
as
opposed
to
nazism
chauvinism
is
an
umbrella
term
for
that
to
some
extent
the
importance
of
ethnic
as
a
political
entity
and
even
in
the
framework
of
nationalism
can
be
identified
as
good
the
national
liberation
movements
and
bad
find
iron
ai
that
oun
nationalist
ideology
were
not
working
i
think
this
option
is
completely
say
charles
stewart
named
leader
of
irish
and
issues
no
one
there
as
a
leader
of
nationalist
sense
is
crucial
for
it
is
the
ai
therefore
from
my
point
of
view
should
be
called
something
like
ukrainian
politician
and
the
leader
of
the
nationalist
movement
and
a
comma
in
the
following
sentence
or
the
nationality
of
the
list
of
areas
where
its
activities
are
and
which
countries
had
it
will
be
valid
in
all
respects
if
on
these
issues
in
general
there
is
agreement
ready
to
write
a
draft
of
the
preamble
june
you
well
said
but
what
does
ukrainian
ukrainian
president
too
but
he
was
not
the
president
of
and
because
he
is
more
leader
of
the
ukrainian
nationalist
movement
than
ukrainian
politician
and
at
the
same
time
or
parallel
the
leader
of
the
ukrainian
it
turns
out
that
the
leader
of
the
ukrainian
nationalist
movement
carried
out
political
and
organizational
activities
are
mainly
in
western
which
was
part
of
poland
and
the
as
well
as
during
the
nazi
occupation
maybe
somewhere
like
that
june
in
general
support
but
here
are
some
to
expand
and
refine
the
leader
of
the
ukrainian
nationalist
movement
carried
out
its
activities
mainly
in
western
which
was
part
of
poland
and
the
soviet
union
as
well
as
during
the
nazi
occupation
june
expand
you
simply
remove
the
reference
to
political
and
institutional
activities
i
just
wanted
to
thereby
indicate
that
he
was
still
a
politician
than
a
field
commander
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
running
around
the
woods
june
no
i
did
not
remove
and
replace
the
political
and
organizational
activities
to
its
activities
expanding
so
a
description
of
activities
because
the
definition
of
leader
of
the
already
imply
the
more
organizational
and
political
activities
than
run
the
woods
with
a
gun
also
i
replaced
the
fascist
occupation
that
terminology
is
inaccurate
to
the
nazi
occupation
june
clearly
the
character
always
carries
his
work
not
someone
else
ie
in
this
case
his
work
has
no
more
information
than
just
work
thats
why
i
was
surprised
that
of
information
you
describe
as
its
extension
june
i
think
that
the
misunderstanding
is
cleared
up
remove
the
information
was
not
i
just
said
but
the
organizational
and
political
the
rest
of
the
activities
that
the
subject
article
also
carried
out
mainly
in
the
said
territory
june
colleagues
let
us
also
discuss
the
proposal
it
is
completely
neutral
and
reflects
the
essence
and
any
would
only
cause
unnecessary
the
ukrainian
means
ukrainian
not
polish
not
jewish
and
june
by
the
way
ukrainian
may
mean
the
from
the
jewish
and
this
does
not
happen
because
jewish
state
called
israel
and
a
state
is
not
at
all
but
even
if
it
was
then
it
would
be
called
and
therefore
belongs
to
would
be
characterized
by
the
word
an
example
of
the
and
in
this
sense
the
between
life
ukrainian
state
has
ever
had
but
with
the
polish
and
ukrainian
you
it
could
be
the
polish
ukrainian
jews
russian
for
what
is
an
adjective
meaning
ukrainian
is
determined
solely
by
the
context
for
it
may
be
the
and
the
ukrainian
rada
that
adjective
applies
to
the
state
a
preamble
and
the
preamble
to
the
fact
it
is
the
first
word
article
the
context
they
are
not
able
to
form
june
after
all
in
he
the
restoration
of
the
ukrainian
state
including
in
this
sense
it
can
be
accurately
called
ukrainian
political
figure
june
in
other
words
you
admit
that
the
use
of
the
phrase
the
ukrainian
politician
in
reference
to
is
a
very
very
specific
ie
marginal
sense
june
no
common
sense
and
as
very
reputable
ai
june
above
you
wrote
that
it
can
be
called
in
this
sense
a
point
was
the
proclamation
of
the
ukrainian
state
recovery
in
the
nazi
occupation
of
the
ukrainian
state
the
ukrainian
ssr
similar
to
the
state
in
many
occupied
countries
of
europe
they
were
just
serving
the
interests
of
the
therefore
it
must
be
noted
meaning
june
no
need
to
ascribe
to
me
what
i
said
and
thought
june
assume
good
intentions
not
exclude
that
understood
you
wrong
in
this
case
i
did
not
quite
clear
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
he
declared
in
the
restoration
of
the
ukrainian
state
including
in
this
sense
it
can
be
accurately
called
ukrainian
political
figure
i
would
be
very
grateful
for
the
clarification
june
apparently
based
on
the
proposal
the
consensus
were
not
come
suggest
that
cut
preamble
to
the
most
leave
only
the
most
neutral
ukrainian
politician
in
years
head
of
the
organization
of
ukrainian
oun
b
everything
else
the
concentration
camp
activities
cooperation
noncooperation
with
the
nazis
in
the
article
the
question
of
whether
to
write
ukrainian
politicians
may
be
sent
to
the
if
and
phd
believe
that
it
is
possible
i
personally
argue
with
them
will
not
june
proposal
arguments
from
mine
why
not
do
the
first
part
of
your
very
neutral
is
explained
by
both
of
us
it
is
strange
that
you
do
not
hear
these
and
keep
the
same
thing
june
we
have
here
a
repetition
of
discussions
you
have
to
repeat
declaration
of
on
the
proclamation
of
the
ukrainian
state
was
as
we
know
only
a
declaration
for
public
tax
system
the
courts
police
border
guards
budget
etc
were
not
established
before
as
we
now
express
the
state
his
state
no
one
has
recognized
and
not
be
able
to
do
this
for
him
the
state
the
existence
of
the
order
of
hours
simply
put
was
not
a
ukrainian
passport
which
would
have
been
recognized
at
least
someone
somewhere
june
so
a
dead
end
or
let
it
remain
as
it
is
or
find
an
intermediary
june
however
the
as
is
as
too
many
to
name
is
not
connected
with
the
struggle
for
the
independence
of
and
the
mass
killings
of
innocent
people
propose
to
exclude
the
phrase
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
movement
for
the
independence
of
then
we
get
in
the
years
head
of
the
organization
of
ukrainian
oun
b
june
judge
not
that
ye
be
not
c
its
time
to
move
away
from
the
subjective
attitude
to
historical
figures
and
present
information
to
start
dry
and
impersonal
the
fact
that
for
many
who
name
of
murder
or
does
not
affect
the
objective
reality
on
the
other
hand
for
many
of
western
and
many
abroad
is
a
symbol
of
the
struggle
for
the
independence
of
against
poland
the
soviet
union
and
germany
we
have
a
number
of
objective
things
that
are
not
by
anyone
a
was
a
leader
of
a
political
force
among
ethnic
and
b
the
main
purpose
of
this
political
force
was
the
construction
of
an
independent
ukrainian
state
june
we
are
gradually
slipping
into
the
main
purpose
of
too
was
the
murder
of
of
millions
of
people
the
man
wanted
for
the
good
of
his
country
that
he
has
however
written
in
the
preamble
of
the
first
few
lines
founder
and
central
figure
of
national
socialism
june
at
the
expense
of
you
are
absolutely
right
example
somewhat
correct
but
in
the
last
years
is
used
widely
unlike
did
not
set
out
to
seize
russia
and
europe
to
the
to
the
atlantic
i
think
you
are
somewhat
subjective
approach
to
the
subject
of
the
article
june
i
am
glad
that
you
are
so
it
gives
hope
for
an
early
consensus
the
is
always
somewhat
flawed
however
it
serves
to
highlight
the
falsity
of
a
thesis
in
this
case
the
thesis
of
the
main
purpose
of
and
highlight
what
for
some
reason
not
mentioned
do
you
think
it
is
by
the
way
you
could
not
speak
specifically
on
the
proposed
in
the
years
head
of
the
organization
of
ukrainian
oun
b
but
not
to
their
opinions
with
an
appeal
not
to
judge
june
perhaps
the
declared
objectives
can
be
most
sublime
but
the
methods
of
their
implementation
different
june
the
phrase
for
the
independence
of
is
neutral
nationalist
not
neutral
i
also
propose
to
complete
this
barren
for
many
people
july
the
phrase
nationalist
the
official
definition
which
was
given
the
organization
he
heads
the
organization
itself
but
because
the
removal
of
such
a
definition
would
july
the
article
said
enough
about
ideology
in
the
cap
is
set
is
not
necessary
im
not
saying
that
the
current
was
set
as
a
compromise
let
compromise
remains
july
that
is
what
the
article
much
on
ideology
and
means
that
the
preamble
should
be
present
the
results
of
this
attention
the
preamble
in
the
form
the
article
or
do
you
think
otherwise
july
colleagues
personally
i
quite
clear
that
in
the
current
debate
format
to
nothing
lead
lets
take
a
look
or
or
leave
the
current
preamble
as
july
i
totally
agree
i
think
that
you
as
the
administrator
may
well
insist
on
an
end
to
the
discussion
and
maintaining
compromise
formula
july
well
what
is
the
compromise
the
of
the
article
is
installed
in
administrative
act
not
developed
as
a
result
of
the
discussion
is
on
closer
inspection
a
reflection
of
just
one
of
the
points
of
view
that
the
of
this
and
insist
here
on
the
sanctity
of
that
phrase
july
do
not
know
who
on
this
formulation
personally
i
am
for
the
leader
of
the
national
liberation
movement
well
or
ukrainian
politician
well
we
will
look
for
july
in
your
place
i
would
have
insisted
because
the
difference
between
the
leader
of
the
movement
for
independence
and
leader
of
the
national
liberation
movement
is
not
visible
to
the
naked
eye
july
i
am
also
a
leader
of
the
national
liberation
movement
so
that
the
current
is
a
compromise
which
should
stop
july
support
july
so
what
we
see
a
group
of
participants
not
to
the
arguments
and
proposals
opponents
instead
of
trying
to
arrange
a
discussion
of
the
vote
on
the
adoption
of
compromise
why
should
you
mediator
july
ai
request
in
the
preamble
you
put
a
request
to
the
sources
claim
that
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
independence
of
could
you
clarify
what
exactly
you
confused
that
was
a
leader
or
that
he
was
in
favor
of
the
independence
of
and
then
well
talk
with
you
more
sorry
i
had
to
use
a
no
au
i
mean
that
statement
the
leader
of
the
movement
for
the
independence
of
in
reference
to
once
it
is
issued
for
a
compromise
here
being
very
unusual
needs
at
least
to
be
supported
authoritative
source
otherwise
this
is
a
common
original
research
and
what
it
is
very
unusual
in
fact
he
was
a
leader
or
is
that
the
independence
of
for
me
personally
this
request
lets
be
consistent
dear
and
do
without
mutual
hasty
accusations
in
violation
of
the
for
example
you
have
missed
in
your
questions
movement
for
independence
i
also
want
to
remind
you
of
your
same
statement
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
is
that
since
it
does
not
describe
the
ai
see
in
writing
the
ai
and
a
leading
figure
of
the
ukrainian
national
liberation
movement
of
the
s
and
s
what
you
put
request
does
not
require
a
literal
compliance
with
the
source
enough
sense
which
is
already
specified
therefore
this
source
can
be
into
the
specified
location
and
close
the
issue
but
first
in
accordance
with
ai
we
need
to
evaluate
the
credibility
of
the
source
the
mentioned
article
is
signed
by
oy
by
find
out
who
it
was
i
could
not
you
help
it
is
an

ab
editorial
board
va
head
is
the
national

of
i
found
out
who
this
is
a
junior
research
fellow
of
the
institute
of
thus
we
view
research
assistant
against
the
opinion
of
academician
d
was
a
nazi
secret
service
agent
on
the
one
hand
on
the
other
hand
led
them
to
political
forces
and
their
bled
never
hesitate
to
declare
that
their
power
must
be
terrible
they
the
fuehrer
of
the
german
people
of
why
should
we
give
preference
to
the
first
forget
about
the
second
i
do
not
understand
let
us
inscribe
then
it
both
first
online
interviews
academician
of
the
academy
of
legal
sciences
of
by
no
ai
in

but
because
of
it
i
will
not
even
are
risen
second
what
you
call
opinion
published
in
the
encyclopedia
on
the
history
prepared
by
the
institute
of
history
of
the

published
to
put
this
into
question
you
need
a
very
very
very
serious
ai
its
about
the
same
as
the
question
the
article
from
well
lets
consider
the
source
as
a
whole
without
regard
to
persons
here
is
a

from
it
in

oun
empty
there
are
proposals
to
use
it
somewhere
or
wait
for
the
respected
publication
should
be
modified
the
internet
does
not
have
to
be
everything
on
this
particular
issue
of
the
source
data
is
that
the
ai
no
doubt
in
the
encyclopedia
articles
are
so
who
the
author
really
does
not
matter
what
else
could
be
a
question
by
the
way
academic
academy
of
legal
sciences
and
his
phd
and
available
in
the
public
domain
which
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
ukrainian
therefore
consider
it
as
ai
we
can
not
in
principle
you
have
not
paid
attention
to
the
first
link
and
its
important
under
it
provides
a
vivid
example
of
the
articles
in
this
encyclopedia
is
clearly
and
rife
not
scientific
all
this
despite
the
fact
that
as
you
say
in
the
encyclopedia
articles
are
article
about
in
my
opinion
too
refers
to
a
set
of
political
articles
in
this
encyclopedia
as
regards
the
allegations
of
then
im
not
very
interested
in
how
the
is
the
title
of
academician
it
is
enough
that
the
man
it
is
as
you
do
not
want
to
make
a
friendly
court
is
editor
of
the
russian
which
can
deprive
title
and
they
do
not
recognize
the
ai
and
if
we
assume
that
academic
legal
science
can
not
give
something
to
estimate
from
the
historical
point
of
view
so
from
a
legal
clearly
overly
and
full
of
is
not
scientific
no
its
not
just
my
opinion
director

the

of
ukrainian
and

of
moscow
state
university
moscow

doctor
of
historical

professor
the
history
of
the
much
more
than
in
russia
has
problems
with
the
fact
that
something
needs
power
from
the
historians
that
is
why
the
use
of
ai
as
this
encyclopedia
created
by
the
institute
of
history
of
it
is
highly
doubtful
written
enough
that
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
his
position
on
the
issue
from
any
point
of
view
in
his
position
there
but
its
purview
is
the
most
direct
academician
was
not
elected
although
he
tried
he
was
elected
as
a
member
of
the
academy
of
legal
sciences
which
is
not
the
academy
of
sciences
if
a
historian
to
assess
the
credibility
of
the
source
has
a
special
page
make
it
appropriate
request
to
state
his
case
stumbled
on
the
ai
which
calls
the
object
of
article
not
otherwise
known
terrorist
the
leader
of
ukrainian
in
the

xx
century
author

professor
i
think
that
this
is
also
a
need
for
some
displayed
in
the
article
why
so
little
things
and
than
say
is
better
than
a
short
course
of
in
general
its
time
to
wrap
up
the
debate
ai
is
given
if
someone
is
not
satisfied
there
is
a
interview
and
famine
in
its
current
form
the
preamble
completely
the
second
pillar
as
for
the
ai
it
is
of
such
quality
that
no
way
again
the
fish
to
change
the
look
of
the
preamble
of
ai
do
not
like
well
why
we
just
insert
according
to
modern
ukrainian
historians
and
thats
that
in
the
end
we
have
there
are
other
ai
that
said
object
article
just
a
terrorist
i
have
four
or
five
times
said
any
change
preamble
in
this
case
i
consider
the
involvement
of
as
a
last
resort
because
it
seems
to
me
that
to
abide
by
its
rules
and
without
external
compulsion
i
made
an
offer
and
you
please
respond
to
it
no
ultimatums
this
is
not
an
ultimatum
but
a
statement
of
fact
prior
to
my
appearance
here
you
yourself
could
not
agree
with
the
opponents
and
hardly
able
but
any
change
in
the
preamble
including
the
insertion
of
the
phrase
according
to
modern
ukrainian
historians
certainly
will
respond
for
example
who
can
either
insert
the
text
according
to
western
historians
e
strange
you
have
the
facts
to
your
appearance
i
just
started
a
discussion
and
a
week
waiting
for
someone
to
respond
the
first
came
with
you
at
first
glance
the
design
proposal
however
after
it
had
to
be
rejected
member
most
reasons
and
offered
a
fairly
accurate
statement
which
can
be
taken
as
a
basis
in
reply
you

in
the

participants
or
member
which
as
participant
was
told
not
only
by
me
naturally
after
a
discussion
about
this
matter
to
the
next
round
and
now
we
have
what
we
have
two
article
nationalist
proclamation
and
prevent
her
and
make
an
additional
language
you
imagine
the
strange
role
of
mediator
it
is
only
a
friendly
control
over
the
implementation
of
the
rules
for
timely
discussion
and
compromise
proposals
you
are
unable
to
follow
the
rules
as
for
the
flood
of
then
you
have
no
one
else
to
blame
them
see
above
threat
to
absolutely
reassure
you
i
do
not
mind
according
to
david
in
abstracts
called
nationalist
and
the
phrase
appears
only
in
connection
with
this
figure
occurring
at
the
moment
in
the
ukrainian
narrative
of
twentieth
century
therefore
in
all
fairness
to
hang
on
the
glorification
of
would
be
hasty
but
the
word
is
not
a
sparrow
once
written
let
it
be
the
preamble
does
not
impose
the
detailed
who
he
thinks
is
written
in
the

itself
insert
into

anywhere
pov
without
we
are
not
allowed
as
fundamental
and
more
specific
rules
of
dear
for
research
question
you
are
giving
too
much
attention
to
russian
scientists
and
ukrainian
politicians
specific
orientation
do
not
you
think
that
in
matters
of
the
states
history
is
to
listen
to
the
opinion
of
our
scientists
and
in
the
opinion
of
foreign
experts
is
meaningful
to
add
to
the
amendment
according
to
in
the
part
of
white
spots
on
the
official
website
of
the
institute
of
history
i
think
you
just
bad
looking
a
few
words
about
the
above
source
first
write
the
movement
for
independence
of
when
at
the
source
ukr
at
least
for
the
preamble
is
not
acceptable
is
a
strong
stretch
and
incorrectly
reflects
the
essence
of
the
movement
i
do
not
think
that
the
terrorist
activities
in
in
the
southeast
of
poland
may
be
described
as
a
movement
for
the
independence
of
then
now
about
the
source
itself
the
information
in
it
is
taken
from
the
two

have
no

and
with
an
explicit
of
the

the
choice
of
this

does
not
speak
in
favor
of

and
the

also
gives
an
incorrect

the

has
been
criticized
for
similar
reasons
administrator

i
think
that
is
quite
enough
information
for
a
request
for
vp
to
this

finally
received
its
proper
evaluation
without
such
an
assessment
opponents
will
not
hear
any
arguments
others
do
not
so
do
not
put
this
request
first
do
not
have
the
ep
voy
dear
remove
the
without
evidence
can
be
as
as
you
know
of
course
i
can
not
pass
judgment
over
all
the
other
like
you
and
is
based
on
the
above
arguments
in
this
discussion
member
gleb
gave
specific
information
about
the
sources
used
to
create
the
article
about
in
obviously
such
a
text
can
not
be
considered
an
authoritative
source
in
addition
the
same
participant
mentioned
that
the
accuracy
of
the
other
articles
in
this
encyclopedia
has
also
been
questioned
by
other
participants
this
means
that
the
check
authority
fully
justified
and
so
what
will
be
checked
by
the
authority
i
do
not
have
the
authority
to
confirm
it
is
confirmed
by
the
institute
of
history
of
youre
trying
to
prove
that
the
source
what
and
cook
be
another
matter
but
since
note
is
not
on
their
work
and
the
other
work
that
the
transaction
influential
people
in
history
involving
their
work
is
another
matter
what
i
agree
with
gleb
is
the
fact
that
the
ukrainian
translated
is
not
quite
true
in
this
particular
case
i
do
not
try
to
prove
anything
but
simply
pointing
out
that
the
editorial
community
had
specific
evidence
to
doubt
the
authenticity
of
this
article
written
by
the
source
which
is
reflected
put
up
a
pattern
reading
of
co
it
is
clear
that
the
claim
is
basically
just
you
i
also
want
to
once
again
that
this
source
is
not
entirely
confirmed
written
language
as
indicated
by
participant
gleb
if
you
set
a
pattern
for
a
newspaper
is
understandable
but
put
this
request
enough
authority
to
have
some
proof
that
i
suggest
to
you
to
provide
for
did
you
read
carefully
gleb
unequivocally
questioned
the
of
the
source
of
it
concrete
evidence
to
do
so
he
offered
questioned
the
authors
based
on
which
the
article
was
written
in
an
encyclopedia
but
not
for
the
encyclopedia
because
the
source
code
and
information
and
past
editor
of
the
review
is
not
the
same
thing
in
this
discussion
has
already
indicated
that
it
is
a
edition
accordingly
even
if
the
authority
authors
doubt
to
this
publication
as
a
whole
is
not
the
case
because
after
the
possible
errors
or
eliminated
or
the
material
does
not
pass
so
the
position
is
justified
i
quote
as
you
seem
to
be
that
far
not
finish
by
the
way
the
aforementioned
encyclopedia
has
been
criticized
for
similar
reasons
administrator
nicholas
the
absurdity
of
some
sort
encyclopedia
created
the
institute
of
history
of
the
academy
of
sciences
as
college
and
degrees
do
you
want
to
show
try
looking
at
the
with
i
led
the
discussion
and
any
references
to
authoritative
sources
which
would
be
talking
about
ai
nas
or
a
particular
job
fraud
or
anything
like
that
he
did
not
present
of
course
that
politicians
and
school
teachers
in
this
matter
will
be
some
time
ill
see
whats
up
with
the
fleet
lets
not
generally
at
rest
although
it
has
other
drawbacks
as
already
pointed
out
focus
on
a
specific
article
in
which
describes
different
from
other
ai
manner
ie
marginal
because
of
this
contradiction
we
can
not
use
the
expression
used
as
reference
to
describe
the
subject
of
the
article
in
addition
vp
ai
limits
the
use
of
sources
and
in
the
russian
marginal
by
default
the
view
is
the
same
ai
accepted
in
the
scientific
community
you
forgot
to
add
the
you
yourself
brought
up
the
source
article
in
which
the
glorification
of
is
characterized
not
only
as
an
example
of
narrative
of
twentieth
century
that
is
beyond
the
scope
of
science
as
such
well
and
what
of
authority
are
not
nothing
much
its
just
that
we
have
here
is
not
respectively
and
ukrainian
historical
narrative
we
got
encyclopedia
in
russian
and
not
russian
encyclopedia
but
because
no
one
country
has
the
priority
whether
it
is
russia
and
so
why
then
in
the
preamble
of
article
preference
is
given
to
ukrainian
sources
and
even
on
language
ai
says
that
the
sources
are
always
to
be
preferred
sources
in
other
languages
equal
quality
and
only
here
you
themselves
rejected
so
well
use
by
the
fact
that
there
is
and
what
about
the
confirm
his
words
only
here
you
yourself
rejected
something
i
forgot
when
this
happened
to
me
so
combinations
of
letters
ukr
seems
to
me
a
mystery
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
it
is
strange
to
see
in
a
publication
of
the
academy
of
sciences
but
for
some
reason
you
are
saying
that
it
is
to
translate
but
still
can
not
be
interpreted
properly
and
on
this
basis
refuse
to
follow
ai
where
i
called
for
the
use
only
sources
diff
please
i
want
to
remind
you
that
the
unfounded
allegations
of
abuse
this
is
a
game
with
rules
ad
is
a
serious
offense
propose
to
hold
discussions
correctly
dear
you
painted
a
very
long
time
which
can
not
be
called
ukrainian
politicians
up
to
this
in
other
words
you
admit
that
the
use
of
the
phrase
the
ukrainian
politician
in
reference
to
is
a
very
very
specific
ie
marginal
sense
refer
to
any
participant
who
owns
ukrainian
perhaps
i
do
not
understand
then
im
sorry
give
for
example
since
consensus
on
the
authority
of
this
encyclopedia
between
us
you
can
go
to
all
this
is
fine
but
as
this
implies
only
here
you
yourself
what
in
the
mistake
in
the
does
not
mean
that
it
should
be
completely
rejected
as
not
the
ai
same
applies
to
i
suggest
not
to
rely
on
it
where
it
openly
lying
but
her
whole
entire
questioned
substitute
what
you
are
those
that
insist
on
its
solidity
i
trust
you
as
much
as
any
party
you
can
not
just
give
the
official
translation
as
required
by
the
rules
i
apologize
be
careful
if
we
had
a
consensus
the
discussion
would
be
redundant
appeal
to
to
this
discussion
is
only
related
since
revealed
new
evidence
of
bias
and
input
source
we
have
to
mark
it
with
the
appropriate
and
to
await
the
outcome
of
the
ep
someone
you
me
or
does
there
party
inquiry
on
the
source
let
me
remind
you
that
we
have
a
sufficient
number
of
ai
in
russian
which
characterize
much
more
neutral
on
the
basis
of
personal
opinion
you
mentioned
formulation
marginal
as
it
can
be
understood
what
do
you
personally
think
that
the
ai
lying
so
i
say
no
evidence
of
bias
i
do
not
see
a
sufficient
number
of
ai
in
russian
i
called
marginal
not
and
the
meaning
you
are
trying
to
make
it
by
writing
it
here
he
declared
in
the
restoration
of
the
ukrainian
state
including
in
this
sense
it
can
be
accurately
called
ukrainian
political
figure
the
is
elementary
wrong
it
is
not
always
written
in
which
is
clearly
visible
propaganda
bias
in
other
words
youre
saying
you
can
not
bring
sources
to
the
leader
of
the
movement
for
the
independence
of
as
well
as
the
leader
of
the
ukrainian
national
liberation
movement
as
required
arcade
game
with
rules
i
still
ignored
although
the
of
such
a
reception
after
the
warning
it
is
not
ethical
you
can
not
see
but
others
see
it
the
conclusion
is
clear
please
i
recall
that
it
was
a
question
of
neutrality
so
the
of
though
no
less
wrong
but
more
neutral
in
addition
there
is
a
phrase
heres
more
will
not
help
you
to
transfer
which
means
the
one
have
limes
arrested
by
the
nazis
and
prisoners
in
the
concentration
camp
july
thanks
a
lot
what
does
for
by
the
a
few
days
later
i
wonder
how
it
managed
to
sitting
in
meet
in
berlin
with
professor
koch
i
assume
that
in
germany
too
were
the
funnel
and
i
can
not
but
where
the
ai
they
were
and
that
was
brought
from
in
this
way
all
the
more
so
in
the
article
itself
says
that
on
july
was
released
there
is
even
easier
the
paper
are
two
events
in
the
same
sentence
so
this
is
not
the
source
is
already
obtained
and
with
a
in
one
in
fact
some
argue
that
this
sitting
under
house
arrest
could
safely
hit
the
road
from
berlin
to
not
to
mention
the
fact
to
visit
each
others
proposals
not
to
normal
source
just
need
to
read
it
carefully
but
other
sources
claim
that
the
was
taken
not
earlier
than
january
in
your
source
says
she
have
limes
if
this
source
is
normal
for
you
we
need
to
define
the
concept
of
a
normal
start
unlike
articles
was
there
and
no
reason
to
lie
to
him
in
this
place
it
says
that
have
limes
do
not
engage
elected
by
the
way
i
do
not
need
to
prove
that
he
was
in
a
concentration
camp
in
the
th
i
already
know
in
general
if
you
do
not
like
the
source
i
quoted
since
you
still
have
to
prove
that
the
flawless
i
am
glad
that
you
finally
acknowledge
that
it
is
not
i
do
not
know
what
about
the
ukrainian
language
with
the
particle
the
one
and
the
russian
particle
and
being
employed
for
a
bunch
of
two
events
with
a
particular
date
means
that
both
of
these
events
occur
in
the
same
day
request
for
filed
please
thats
ai
who
became
the
most
prominent
figure
in
western
ukrainian
national
liberation
movement
journal
of
national
history
sciences
institute
of
growing
up
history
the
book
i
think
i
understood
the
reason
for
your
rejection
of
this
language
in
fact
considered
a
champion
of
independence
of
western
from
poland
hence
the
phrase
the
ai
not
required
since
the
most
figure
is
not
a
leader
and
western
ukrainian
national
liberation
movement
is
not
the
ukrainian
national
liberation
movement
a
ai
in
the
ukrainian
language
is
and
b
the
distinction
between
the
most
figure
and
leader
are
minimum
and
that
movement
is
not
a
the
forensic
the
ai
weak
and
b
still
have
this
face
and
i
would
not
advise
you
to
try
to
overcome
it
without
the
help
of
the
ai
and
c
is
not
identical
to
the
total
private
it
is
elementary
neutrality
is
not
facts
and
with
the
presentation
of
their
positions
i
hope
you
do
not
aim
to
deny
the
facts
of
terrorism
as
for
the
freedom
fighter
it
is
not
a
fact
and
evaluation
you
can
detail
what
you
mean
when
you
say
the
activities
of
wider
than
the
oun
leadership
and
the
terrorist
and
freedom
fighter
yes
but
the
terrorist
is
an
assessment
of
an
authoritative
source
and
freedom
fighter
what
is
unique
and
why
in
the
statement
is
not
written
on
the
western
and
poland
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
movement
for
the
independence
of
formulation
in
ai
says
has
become
the
most
prominent
figure
in
western
ukrainian
national
liberation
because
the
program
of
the
should
be
read
not
just
cling
to
the
points
and
the
goal
was
to
achieve
independence
of
in
general
not
a
separate
part
of
it
west
east
or
northwest
regarding
terrorism
you
can
articulate
who
and
when
under
what
laws
poland
germany
mongolia
recognized
terrorist
i
think
that
in
order
to
meet
the
neutrality
you
will
be
hard
to
provide
a
specific
legal
act
of
any
country
of
your
choice
which
clearly
would
have
the
concept
of
terrorism
to
be
valid
at
the
time
of
the
life
of
stephen
a
and
on
the
basis
of
which
against
him
would
a
criminal
case
on
the
grounds
of
terrorism
even
if
for
neutral
and
does
not
go
through
the
courts
i
hope
you
do
not
aim
the
denial
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
in
legal
practice
in
general
and
in
particular
in
the
construction
of
the
we
discuss
here
the
respected
so
to
the
periods
and
should
not
annoy
you
if
your
goal
i
would
ask
you
not
to
be
concerned
with
the
discussion
of
my
emotional
state
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
not
a
subject
of
discussion
in
general
and
this
form
of
discussion
is
not
welcome
administration
because
of
the
rules
in
particular
what
i
put
target
to
enter
into
a
discussion
with
you
its
only
one
i
know
unless
of
course
you
do
not
have
psychic
therefore
and
this
issue
i
would
ask
you
not
to
touch
at
the
same
time
on
the
other
hand
i
can
assure
you
that
i
have
been
sufficiently
by
the
issues
that
you
are
discussing
here
because
as
the
default
closely
following
the
progress
of
the
controversy
proceeding
from
the
little
that
is
left
of
your
post
after
attempts
personal
attack
of
me
i
can
safely
assume
that
for
some
unknown
reason
to
me
you
do
not
fully
become
clear
sense
of
my
previous
message
im
not
hard
to
explain
easier
maybe
i
could
you
have
for
a
long
time
require
ai
the
regarding
the
leader
of
the
national
liberation
movement
for
various
reasons
i
can
not
respond
to
you
to
date
there
is
only
a
clear
definition
of
terrorism
your
opinion
about
the
only
clear
definition
of
terrorism
will
surely
be
appreciated
by
the
discussion
of
the
article
which
somehow
that
terrorism
in
states
that
the
last
stage
of
capitalism
followed
by
the
socialist
revolution
i
take
on
the
burden
of
proof
back
link
to
dictionary
on
your
part
is
somewhat
not
serious
given
the
fact
that
you
also
put
into
question
the
credibility
of
the
institute
of
history
of
the
academy
of
sciences
of
one
of
the
european
states
authorship
of
the
article
to
which
you
referred
me
to
set
hard
and
therefore
i
have
doubts
as
to
the
competence
of
person
group
of
people
who
worked
on
the
article
if
you
know
the
author
lets
discuss
as
part
of
the
article
terrorism
it
is
believed
that
articles
are
not
ai
the
assertion
that
there
is
no
single
accepted
legal
definition
of
terrorism
there
is
no
true
as
in
every
country
its
criminal
laws
and
the
formulation
is
different
so
i
asked
you
before
and
decide
please
you
have
to
take
written
in
the
ai
faith
this
is
ai
or
to
approach
it
my
approach
supported
and
vp
ai
as
for
your
statement
about
my
forgetfulness
i
would
note
your
confusion
read
the
discussion
above
on
the
page
you
claim
to
do
this
carefully
there
you
will
find
the
information
you
need
including
the
author
on
the
basis
of
the
criminal
law
of
the
country
which
will
qualify
the
we
will
not
qualify
draws
action
on
any
basis
we
will
carefully
study
written
in
at
our
disposal
ai
in
addition
we
do
not
ascribe
to
other
participants
in
the
discussion
of
what
they
did
you
are
calling
into
question
the
credibility
of
the
institute
of
history
of
the
academy
of
sciences
of
one
of
the
european
countries
spontaneous
on
the
topic
of
the
subject
of
study
as
science
must
be
terrorism
certainly
interesting
and
original
but
the
place
they
are
not
here
and
in
the
discussion
of
the
article
you
are
the
source
of
lead
i
can
not
guess
which
part
of
the
discussion
to
seek
answers
to
their
questions
lets
return
to
our
well
again
deadlock
i
propose
to
return
to
the
option
ukrainian
politician
in
years
i
recall
that
we
discussed
the
of
the
source
of
the
phrase
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
movement
for
the
independence
of
and
came
to
certain
conclusions
can
you
start
to
remove
the
link
from
the
article
on
this
source
and
restore
request
we
have
not
come
to
any
conclusions
what
i
suggested
option
does
not
mean
that
i
agree
with
you
once
you
rate
it
so
i
write
in
the
previous
section
the
purpose
of
the
oun
vp
before
drawing
conclusions
original
data
and
where
do
the
tribune
and
what
data
should
be
checked
then
that
oun
leader
or
that
the
purpose
of
the
oun
was
to
build
an
independent
ukrainian
state
tribune
though
here
an
article
about
and
you
goals
oun
the
war
by
the
way
even
if
the
original
data
in
your
syllogism
are
true
then
the
conclusion
is
still
false
because
it
is
not
the
leader
of
the
movement
he
has
his
own
goals
each
of
the
leaders
the
discussion
of
articles
about
i
gave
you
two
statements
that
a
definition
of
the
subject
of
the
article
the
fact
that
you
have
taken
for
the
proclamation
of
my
goals
oun
is
none
other
than
one
of
these
i
do
not
identify
with
the
leader
of
the
movement
be
careful
i
merely
stated
the
fact
that
was
a
leader
of
the
movement
a
certain
direction
at
least
one
of
your
statements
are
not
based
on
the
ai
so
it
is
your
return
and
original
research
which
in
particular
are
the
conclusions
of
the
form
a
and
b
were
sitting
on
the
tube
by
that
you
are
not
careful
again
as
refute
me
which
of
the
two
of
the
kind
of
statements
are
not
based
on
the
ai
others
consider
your
subjective
opinion
you
know
dear
so
do
not
keep
the
conversation
discussion
in
is
talking
if
you
are
constantly
arguments
interlocutor
subjective
opinions
unworthy
of
attention
the
source
does
not
have
to
pay
attention
to
you
the
more
that
you
are
not
here
yet
generated
nothing
but
subjective
opinions
and
are
not
going
to
seem
to
make
any
improvements
in
the
article
you
too
much
attention
to
me
personally
how
do
you
explain
your
statement
that
you
are
not
careful
again
as
refute
me
but
to
the
subjective
evaluation
of
the
discussion
do
you
allow
the
illogical
conclusion
regarding
my
humble
person
and
expect
me
positive
response
i
do
not
advocate
to
get
personal
in
the
discussion
in
fact
i
am
against
it
if
you
have
me
have
a
particular
claim
indicate
their
scope
and
provide
the
appropriate
arguments
moreover
i
have
not
written
any
where
that
perceive
your
arguments
unworthy
of
attention
i
so
far
does
not
intend
to
make
in
the
article
any
improvements
but
try
to
keep
a
separate
statement
in
the
article
the
arguments
i
have
given
to
your
right
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
me
but
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
consensus
to
article
on
the
issues
that
you
raised
can
not
be
made
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
the
right
not
to
pay
attention
to
me
is
used
twice
well
yes
i
admit
illogical
conclusion
and
you
have
one
paragraph
you
are
giving
too
much
attention
to
me
vs
are
the
right
not
to
pay
attention
to
me
is
used
twice
but
all
the
conclusions
are
logical
i
will
not
analyze
all
written
here
before
it
would
take
too
much
time
and
space
and
few
are
interested
just
key
points
go
to
the
person
you
are
too
much
focus
on
vp
epo
for
comparison
the
reaction
to
the
mere
mention
of
your
condition
and
your
assumption
of
a
target
but
it
later
violation
of
ai
this
rule
is
recommended
to
listen
to
a
authoritative
sources
b
sources
in
russian
and
is
not
our
scientists
as
you
say
the
orientation
contemptuous
statement
that
i
need
to
do
because
of
the
program
should
be
read
not
just
to
cling
to
the
periods
and
ep
ep
then
there
you
should
be
original
research
then
the
question
is
can
you
articulate
who
and
when
under
what
laws
poland
germany
mongolia
recognized
terrorist
i
do
not
have
to
define
it
as
well
as
reading
program
oun
on
this
we
have
secondary
ai
rhetorical
questions
like
i
hope
you
do
not
put
yourself
to
the
denial
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
in
legal
practice
in
general
and
in
the
construction
in
particular
difficult
for
me
to
comment
since
they
are
in
my
opinion
have
only
an
ornamental
character
introduction
i
would
ask
you
not
to
touch
what
i
put
a
goal
its
only
one
i
know
i
would
ask
you
not
to
touch
it
is
unknown
where
will
the
application
assuming
some
what
remains
of
your
post
after
attempts
personal
attacks
in
my
address
and
the
like
at
the
end
of
the
original
study
and
again
request
the
ai
its
basis
as
if
i
have
to
back
up
your
research
sources
meanwhile
the
ai
which
my
was
at
that
time
is
given
for
more
than
two
months
in
general
its
nothing
new
what
is
called
the
ep
inaudible
intermittent
and
arguments
about
what
the
link
is
somewhat
not
serious
finally
i
had
to
try
to
structure
the
debate
instead
of
essentially
a
request
for
a
long
time
given
the
source
and
the
complaint
about
what
you
can
not
naturally
the
answer
to
that
is
nothing
i
think
we
may
still
be
best
to
suspend
communication
as
there
is
a
complete
lack
of
understanding
i
understand
that
the
answers
did
not
really
follow
the
theme
and
raised
you
closed
in
essence
what
the
only
specific
request
in
your
previous
message
was
if
you
have
me
have
a
particular
claim
indicate
their
scope
and
provide
the
appropriate
arguments
i
responded
to
it
the
desired
range
of
approximately
vp
very
good
so
on
this
and
stop
hopefully
following
this
rule
the
more
you
raise
these
questions
will
not
first
the
article
is
not
ai
and
for
the
poets
and
writers
essential
language
and
not
government
for
is
also
important
and
ai
you
have
something
confused
calls
our
hero
is
not
a
revolutionary
politician
which
does
not
imply
the
destruction
of
the
political
system
which

sudden
appearance

well
lets
start
with
the
advisory
mediation
candidacy
i
have
already
mentioned
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
any
of
the
proposed
candidates
i
can
use
any
arbitrator
including
the
former
the
proposal
for
a
consensus
in
the
preamble
based
on
the
observations
the
activity
wider
than
the
oun
leadership
what
we
need
is
a
mediator
the
error
in
the
article
i
see
that
so
far
on
the
page
there
is
a
pattern
show
heroes
of
because
with
the
decision
of
the
ukrainian
court
on
june
is
not
true
i
propose
to
remove
this
source
the
decision
has
not
come
into
force
court
exceeded
its
authority
from
a
legal
point
of
view
of
the
law
the
opinion
of
the
president
in
this
case
does
not
mean
anything
i
will
read
the

again

the
added

i
had
three
please
help
us
find
a
mutual
consensus
once
again
i
draw
your
attention
that
the
article
is
in
search
of
consensus
look
though
would
be
a
pattern
at
the
beginning
of
the
rules
of
the
regime
read
the
rules

are

there
was
no

despite
the
fact
that
the

what

the

then
how
would
match
intentions

historical
truth
turns
out
whats
in

is
striking
because
it
is
a

from
the
archives
of
the
which
as
noted
was
first
introduced
in
the

how
did

get

have
to

you
for

as
a

just

the

your
comment
is
not
in
its
may
not
be
entirely
correct

misleading
miller

will
explain

its
worth
it
miller
is
seen
from
the
quotation
dear
i
miller
unfortunately
did
not
know
exactly
what
the
quote
says
graduated
seem
historical
archives
making
such
would
be
worth
to
check
the
information
and
not
to
say
what
they
think
next
miller
himself
never
since
the
profession
was
not
working
and
then
says
out
of
three
or
four
books

now
the
publication
of
books
on

book
in
content
more
or
less
decent
in
my
opinion
the
argument
for
and
not
against
miller
did
not
find
how
to
refute
as
a
historian
but
how
to
get
access
to
the
archives
of
the
russian
an
absolutely
thats
where
that
quote
and
i
led
a
rating
of
more
or
less
heard
publicly
from
the
lips
of
the
venerable
historian
as
in
my
opinion
can
only
have
one
value
wit
here
i
am
about
look
in
the
archive
that
i
wrote
in
the
context
read
please
carefully
while
discussing
it
on
a
lot
of
in
any
case
how
does
this
affect
the
proposal
to
put
it
on
one
more
note
to
the
opponents
i
this
is
why
it
is
not
so
from
here
these
credibility
is
the
author
of
a
respected
expert
in
the

to
determine
this

to
answer

at

the

if

straight
without

i
do
not

such
as
a

to
treat

perhaps
it
is
quite
a
nice
person

interesting
writer
not
argue
but
let
remind
you
that
in
respective

of
authors
such
as
selective
approach
to
the
sources
those
sources
which
can
be
found
that
the
positive
articles
on
the
subject
understood
by
and
check
their
to
the
subject
in
life
you
have
all
the
requirements
of
the

rules
of

currently
not
hunt
rummage
co
data
items
for
the

few
years
in
the
end
if
there
is
at

some
information
that
the
author
even
if
all
the
signs
of
the
ai
this
part
of
the
material
was
placed
in
a
section
b
on
its
own
version
and
their
supporters
that
is
no
one
that
there
are
two
versions
of
the
events
vs
the
reason
will
not
respond
to
your
comments
simple
you
have
changed
your
mind
about
not
colleague
for
what
you
were
not
able
to
inexperience
a
warning
a
year
ago
for
the
fact
that
you
lost
the
debate
went
to
my
co
and
called
me
a
not
only
that
apparently
you
have
it
and
are
proud
of
adding
to
its
current
response
to
a
reference
to
the
event
by
the
way
make
an
offer
but
a
warning
anything
can
happen
but
heres
my
no
one
accused
are
you
sure
that
you
understand
the
correct
meaning
of
this
phenomenon
by
the
way
a
few
years
on
the
project
in
contrast
to
their
opponents
not
only
did
i
have
never
been
banned
but
did
not
have
the
warning
basically
your
point
of
view
i
understand
you
can
not
answer
two
comments
legal
rights
the
fact
that
someone
had
not
violated
any
law
is
not
an
argument
in
support
of
the
fact
that
this
man
can
not
break
it
in
the
future
in
replica
vs
the
reason
will
not
respond
to
your
comments
simple
there
is
a
science
thank
you
this
will
help
resolve
our
as
it
will
be
easier
to
solve
i
also
applied
for
the
review
used
to
and
or
more
precisely
ukrainian
act
thank
you
all
for
your
continued
in
discussion
the
proposal
does
not
go
beyond
the
subject
of
the
article
i
think
that
would
be
the
right
stick
to
the
topic
articles
and
represent
its
subject
if
an
article
about
as
are
likely
not
worth
here
as
a
rubbish
pit
to
dump
all
that
in
any
way
for
his
fellow
party
members
members
of
the
movement
and
that
qualified
geographical
divisions
if
the
article
is
written
that
someone
not
a
historian
in
our
case
publicist
and
politician
and
the
politician
influential
one
of
the
most
prominent
soviet
dissidents
and
their
opinion
is
that
it
means
but
thats
not
the
case
if
you
pay
attention
we
present
the
statement
in
part
directly
not
and
his
team
youre
in
denial
of
her
opinion
is
information
on
and
content
of
individual
starting
with
the
phrase
in
spite
of
it
what
does
this
have
to
himself
where
rebuttal
statements
regards
i
find
it
necessary
to
cancel
your
as
not
directly
related
to
the
subject
of
the
article
your
position
is
clear
initially
my
edit
has
been
rejected
due
to
doubts
about
the
of
sources
well
awarded
we
talk
a
little
bit
about
different
things
i
stress
again
that
the
article
directly
on
and
his
personal
role
in
the
story
everything
related
to
makes
sense
to
make
the
appropriate
article
and
i
would
ask
you
if
you
can
not
evaluate
my
actions
i
i
can
answer
your
questions
sorry
that
did
not
do
it
before
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
answers
are
obvious
any
law
which
required
the
consent
of
were
not
adopted
as
laws
of
the
host
state
and
the
state
very
short
time
just
did
not
do
it
do
not
extreme
i
can
not
answer
because
i
could
not
see
myself
the
question
if
the
article
does
not
replica
then
i
would
not
add
to
the
facts
however
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
added
to
article
adding
her
remarks
made
to
try
to
show
a
side
view
it
tries
to
show
the
replica
from
which
is
not
exactly
objective
should
therefore
be
to
give
a
more
objective
assessment
of
the
situation
the
page
is
a
check
neutrality
this
replica
is
less
than
neutral
especially
in
light
of
the
facts
i
have
shown
further
if
it
was
for
the
jews
and
against
the
killing
that
would
retain
such
data
that
oh
played
for
them
but
they
are
not
silent
when
his
men
are
killed
at
least
according
to
my
agreement
now
the
answer
to
each
of
the
items
a
any
law
which
required
the
consent
of
were
not
adopted
as
laws
of
the
host
state
and
the
state
very
short
time
youre
right
we
can
replace
the
word
laws
to
of
people
whose
power
was
not
the
recognition
i
think
the
main
thing
here
is
not
what
laws
or
not
but
how
do
advised
of
these
guidelines
and
what
they
did
following
them
b
do
not
extreme
i
can
not
answer
because
i
could
not
see
myself
the
question
what
do
you
think
some
of
his
extreme
yes
that
even
if
he
does
not
resist
and
did
not
try
to
resist
the
caused
against
humanity
and
against
the
jews
even
though
he
was
in
power
after
all
if
he
did
not
agree
with
the
policy
of
killing
jews
he
could
say
a
word
im
not
talking
business
to
show
a
is
not
responsible
for
the
actions
of
members
of
his
party
to
which
he
gave
no
indication
as
a
leader
but
he
did
not
answer
and
no
one
accuses
his
credit
at
least
that
he
did
not
resist
this
once
and
that
should
be
disclosed
in
the
subject
i
would
initially
made
but
editing
would
have
removed
as
even
the
first
act
of
for
the
source
do
not
think
for
a
long
time
he
was
even
deprived
of
the
ability
to
effectively
lead
as
he
was
isolated
in
a
german
concentration
camp
but
with
this
im
sorry
let
disagree
from
an
article
about
we
see
that
the
germans
arrested
after
a
few
days
after
the
act
of
proclamation
of
the
ukrainian
state
july
a
against
jews
were
openly
written
before
june
in
act
of
s
this
was
before
his
arrest
if
he
did
not
agree
with
the
persecution
of
the
jews
he
could
fix
the
act
initially
i
would
have
easily
and
would
remove
my
facts
if
removed
replica
but
after
trying
all
doubt
from
the
fact
data
sources
leash
would
gloss
over
the
truth
i
think
that
her
remarks
and
facts
have
a
right
to
life
notice
in
the
supplement
i
even
tried
to
show
that
it
was
for
the
murder
of
jews
or
consent
to
the
dear
everything
that
just
it
is
your
personal
conclusions
maybe
they
are
correct
but
all
based
on
personal
findings
fall
within
the
definition
oris
do
you
have
a
specific
data
confirmed
ai
directly
refute
the
words
if
there
is
make
changes
on
the
basis
thereof
if
not
cancel
your
in
this
piece
as
not
directly
relevant
to
the
topic
try
not
to
walk
around
and
remember
that
does
not
stand
yes
in
two
phases
charges
oris
walk
around
and
stand
i
thought
we
were
discussing
the
article
and
not
my
actions
but
okay
in
this
paper
after
the
addition
no
changes
oris
does
not
appear
we
already
went
through
that
and
primary
sources
not
oris
next
i
just
do
not
go
around
dear
colleague
to
the
above
i
have
nothing
to
add
your
arguments
about
the
necessity
of
your
recent
have
not
convinced
me
as
a
result
of
the
discussion
on
this
issue
is
no
consensus
i
have
to
cancel
your
for
the
following
reasons
supplement
does
not
contain
direct
information
on
as
describes
the
actions
of
third
parties
addition
is
not
contrary
to
the
view
as
it
contains
no
information
about
any
person
calls
for
the
extermination
of
the
jews
at
the
same
time
sets
a
goal
starting
with
the
phrase
in
spite
of
this
opinion
which
is
a
substitute
item
of
evidence
by
itself
the
addition
does
not
fit
the
theme
of
partition
as
it
does
not
contain
the
public
reasoning
need
this
supplement
only
in
that
it
is
based
on
the
ai
in
itself
a
basis
for
making
it
in
the
article
can
not
be
in
the
presence
of
the
above
three
points
sorry
but
canceled
without
my
consent
is
also
not
a
consensus
if
you
so
want
to
show
that
was
personally
against
the
jews
and
want
to
direct
calls
against
jews
you
get
i
had
to
search
but
i
found
them
ai
to
have
been
confirmed
by
you
morning
of
july
on
the
walls
were
with
regional
appeal
oun
b
the
people
know
moscow
poland
jews
its
your
enemy
destroy
them
know
your
guide
is
the
ukrainian
nationalist
it
your
leader
thanks
to
cancel
the
changes
introduced
without
discussion
on
which
consensus
had
not
been
reached
a
new
consensus
is
needed
she
canceled
im
glad
you
finally
after
began
to
edit
articles
with
the
same
theme
began
to
go
into
the
subject
i
for
one
if
not
in
the
subject
in
the
articles
of
chemistry
their
rules
do
not
presume
in
light
of
the
above
you
access
the
local
headquarters
oun
b
advise
further
delve
into
the
subject
to
understand
the
structure
of
the
oun
b
in
general
and
in
the
difference
between
the
local
headquarters
and
central
wire
oun
b
in
particular
i
hope
this
is
an
intuitive
help
answer
the
question
allow
me
to
add
dear
how
can
you
explain
the
following
situation
your
last
contains
information
that
one
of
the
examples
is
the
fact
that
the
morning
of
july
the
walls
were
with
regional
appeal
oun
b
signed
by
the
the
people
know
moscow
poland
jews
we
will
not
reduce
to
an
absurdity
the
were
signed
your
leader
you
obviously
read
a
depression
in
the
topic
i
was
referring
to
your
particular
case
i
am
familiar
with
the
theme
of
the
first
sources
i
spoke
to
the
people
in
who
are
seen
with
their
own
eyes
and
the
murder
of
the
jews
so
i
read
a
lot
no
need
to
in
my
competence
the
second
time
i
ask
you
not
to
discuss
a
paper
just
please
do
not
misinterpret
the
fact
that
he
wrote
adoption
that
the
ukrainian
leader
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
personally
called
for
the
destruction
of
the
jews
you
take
words
and
tears
apart
the
people
know
moscow
poland
jews
where
did
you
get
this
confidence
that
the
appeal
signed
i
have
nothing
like
this
in
the
source
is
not
found
could
you
cite
the
place
where
it
is
all
about
you
distort
the
meaning
of
written
in
it
has
been
written
that
the
appeal
signed
russian
language
there
were
over
the
signature
of
that
is
fully
consistent
with
the
best
of
our
ai
and
with
your
approach
here
and
no
has
not
explain
to
me
the
difference
between
signed
and
over
the
signature
of
you
have
seen
the
document
where
there
signature
do
not
the
facts
you
know
very
well
that
your
scan
as
i
did
not
use
the
ai
though
the
text
is
similar
my
ai
in
the
at
the
end
of
my
ai
wrote
your
leader
i
think
thats
an
option
acceptable
to
all
on
the
walls
were
with
regional
appeal
oun
b
containing
the
following
appeals
the
people
know
moscow
poland
jews
its
your
enemy
destroy
them
know
your
guide
is
the
ukrainian
nationalist
it
your
leader
dear
i
think
i
realized
what
was
happening
i
quote
from
circulation
taken
out
of
context
and
ends
with
the
phrase
your
leader
i
take
into
account
your
opinion
in
your
last
sentence
there
is
nowhere
stated
that
a
leaflet
was
get
a
grasp
then
even
more
so
this
text
has
no
relation
to
the
section
of
public
opinion
in
general
and
to
the
approval
in
particular
what
then
are
we
arguing
this
text
is
relevant
to
the
section
just
named
him
the
leader
of
the
movement
engaged
in
the
destruction
of
the
jews
which
is
somewhat
contrary
to
the
purity
of
the
latter
where
there
is
directly
called
leaders
of
the
movement
and
even
take
past
tense
the
destruction
of
the
jews
the
people
of
this
movement
and
why
now
discussion
away
it
originally
was
a
member
of
the
desire
to
refute
the
based
on
publications
as
long
as
this
does
not
work
or
add
on
a
do
not
care
so
be
on
the
safe
side
about
the
purity
do
not
understand
can
we
move
on
from
the
barrage
to
the
of
form
factor
the
fact
that
claims
to
be
the
all
as
in
organizations
certainly
significant
around
this
silence
can
not
be
one
way
or
another
the
ai
promote
your
language
and
do
not
cling
to
the
days
of
the
i
have
there
is
a
error
was
made
if
that
you
can
add
this
to
another
section
if
you
do
not
want
a
light
tarnish
the
name
bright
name
until
ruin
does
not
work
all
attempts
to
refute
what
was
said
in
that
hour
do
not
succeed
if
it
does
not
get
from
the
topic
of
discussion
lord
well
i
found
that
after
three
weeks
of
debate
and
find
direct
evidence
confirmation
ai
we
can
add
to
the
article
i
would
like
to
know
when
we
can
finally
add
an
edit
what
to
do
in
the
case
where
one
party
or
group
is
trying
to
prevent
the
addition
of
the
truth
prompt
i
still
stand
on
the
issue
of
mediation
and
arbitration
in
the
selected
only
participant
who
has
already
shown
in
this
experience
now
just
try
to
treat
something
and
it
is
only
a
discussion
and
i
am
not
basic
result
i
do
not
mind
thank
you
for
such
a
peaceful
response
yes
the
mediator
in
this
case
formulation
the
proposal
is
i
have
no
objections
the
question
i
have
proposed
a
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
ukrainian
nationalist
movement
caused
a
violent
reaction
one
of
the
leaders
and
of
the
organization
of
ukrainian
was
ignored
hence
on
a
similar
approach
on
my
part
caused
objections
of
opponents
before
the
article
was
put
on
the
mode
of
seeking
consensus
thank
you
for
and
i
apologize
that
rarely
happens
on
than
added
corrected
thats
right
my
oversight
about
the
signature
it
is
unclear
why
the
call
for
violence
if
the
organization
is
not
only
encouraged
but
also
and
mass
murder
see
massacre
for
example
well
all
won
it
is
not
clear
what
relationship
leaflet
local
headquarters
for
and
so
has
a
modern
public
opinion
i
certainly
understand
the
burning
desire
for
a
number
of
participants
compete
with
but
maybe
it
makes
sense
to
do
in
the
article
about
her
or
a
burning
desire
as
one
of
the
participants
of
tell
the
truth
the
requirement
is
reasonable
and
objective
presentation
of
the
material
what
does
this
add
to
the
formulation
that
was
a
leader
of
the
call
for
violence
tell
me
what
political
forces
that
in
world
war
ii
did
not
call
for
violence
or
were
those
who
fought
for
the
chess
table
please
just
was
extremely
angry
period
at
what
is
in
the
article
about
holocaust
he
in
the
extermination
of
the
jews
or
in
person
to
organize
where
and
when
during
his
stay
in
sorry
but
the
article
on
individual
points
is
carried
to
absurd
the
rhetorical
question
whether
to
participate
in
the
destruction
of
the
jews
you
can
answer
that
a
number
of
ai
said
that
being
in
not
stop
him
lead
the
oun
b
and
in
any
case
he
just
the
organization
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
when
the
oun
b
in
the
holocaust
would
like
to
wish
you
success
in
combat
and
political
training
and
did
not
take
part
in
this
play
but
still
i
can
not
ask
a
couple
of
questions
first
of
all
keep
yourself
your
statements
are
disrespectful
to
opponents
and
a
violation
of
the

not

go

a
long
list
of

the

casuistry
similar

the

you

in

first
your

is
set
out

impolite

i

correct
me
if
my

is
inaccurate
the
historian
like
others
has
shown
that
and
his
representatives
and
the
nazi
obsession
with
one
thing
in
common
namely
the
idea
that
the

were
behind
the
communism
and
and
must
be
destroyed
soviet
jews
the
statement
read
in
it
is
the
most
loyal
supporters
of
the
bolshevik
regime
and
the
vanguard
of
in
the
when
the

promised
to
work
together
with

then
helped

in

killed
four
thousand

several

a
conclusion
how

and
who
helped
them
in
this
in
any
case
this
does
not
prove
direct
personal
role
in
we
are
talking
about
some

in

we
have
some
other
statement
and
several
other

the

like
others
has
shown
your
questions
to
the
wrong

please
contact
the

similarly
irrelevant
subsequent

such
you

this

because
in

you
obviously
have
nothing
to

i
think
this
section
of

ended
you
just
insulted
me
as
a

as
a

who
besides

that
you

dear
if
you
pay
attention
to
the
content
of
the
above
discussion
i
have
repeatedly
asked
you
to
provide
evidence
to
support
a
direct
involvement
of
oun
in
purposeful
systematic
extermination
of
jews
and
personal
role
in
this
process
since
you
have
put
forward
this
statement
to
justify
the
fact
that
the
article
was
assigned
to
the
project
holocaust
for
several
days
i
tried
to
find
out
on
what
basis
these
findings
were
made
in
support
of
its
assertion
you
quoted
from
the
work
of
which
in
no
way
your
statement
does
not
confirm
in
all
of
this
to
my
request
to
confirm
at
least
the
website
you
link
to
a
description
of
another
author
dear
i
was
the
most
constructive
and
led
the
five
ai
to
support
his
claim
so
long
as
you
do
not
understand
in
english
i
had
to
translate
for
you
personally
two
from
one
of
these
ai

norman

if
you
can
not
understand
it
all
or
do
not
see
in
these
passages
confirm
my
words
then
i
have
already
can
not
help
you
sorry
norman
gouda
we
have
not
discussed
and
it
works
you
quote
to
prove
his
point
of
view
does
not
lead
tell
me
where
you
quoted
this
author
because
i
have
the
impression
that
you
are
not
telling
the
truth
if
im
wrong
happy
to
apologize
to
you
if
you
love
to
please
apologize
this
was
a
direct
translation
of
the
two
fragments
of
articles
gouda
at
the
end
of
his
remarks
that
i
have
sorry
i
did
not
finish
by
and
large
this
issue
is
not
very
principled
regardless
of
who
the
author
is
the
mentioned

does
not
say
where
when
and
how
the
actions

the
fact

you
are
right

the

if
it

there
is
nothing

cancel
since
the

was

i
the

concerned
only
the

have
to

that
is

from
a

point

in

we
need
to
rearrange

places

perception
article
reader
preamble
i
changed
a
little
preamble
and
add
the
neutral
definition
ukrainian
politician
and
nationalist
i
think
these
definitions
do
not
carry
any
positive
such
as
party
national
liberation
movement
or
negative
called
the
killings
in
accordance
with
and
examples
given
there
such
issues
are
better
discussed
in
advance
the
question
of
the
the
ukrainian
politician
has
already
been
discussed
in
section
nationalist
whether
the
organization
of
ukrainian
and
rejected
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
subject
matter
of
any
articles
of
ukrainian
and
the
presence
of
the
polish
and
german
i
think
given
that
he
was
a
nationalist
then
first
and
foremost
important
to
formal
and
ethnic
ukrainian
nationalist
would
be
true
but
the
ukrainian
politician
moreover
this
definition
is
given
in
the
and
new
encyclopedia
publishing
house
in
my
completely
authoritative
sources
this
tertiary
sources
vp
ai
using
them
only
in
extreme
cases
imprecision
of
the
phrase
has
already
been
demonstrated
besides
there
are
other
similar
sources
which
use
different
sources
in
the
same
section
in
this
case
it
would
have
a
source
this
is
where
in
the
tertiary
sources
recommended
only
as
a
last
resort
quote
can
be
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
the
way
this
phrase
ai
tertiary
source
in
turn
the
secondary
in
most
cases
is
a
tertiary
source
besides
i
have
not
seen
anywhere
else
in
the
rules
mention
tertiary
sources
this
is
simply
inaccurate
tertiary
sources
such
as
the
more
authoritative
much
secondary
and
are
widely
used
as
the
ai
the
assertion
that
the
not
ukrainian
and
polish
already
described
as
ak
ad
you
just
do
not
pay
attention
that
if
human
activities
affect
the
nation
as
a
whole
his
nationality
is
not
important
so
im
not
so
with
the
spirit
of
not
to
pay
attention
to
what
is
written
in
the
rules
so
let
not
believe
your
judgment
about
much
greater
credibility
tertiary
sources
do
not
think
that
this
part
of
the
decision
is
a
reference
to
the
ak
its
validity
to
the
questions
on
the
application
of
i
did
not
get
an
explanation
so
i
think
this
sending
irrelevant
the
thesis
about
and
can
be
seen
that
this
thesis
has
been
above
february
i
will
not
repeat
except
to
say
that
the
phrase
the
ukrainian
poet
and
ukrainian
writer
appeal
to
values
in
contrast
to
the
ukrainian
politics
first
you
are
wrong
in
relation
to
the
politician
just
as
you
can
apply
items
second
check
what
is
the
consensus
i
supported
you
are
mistaken
the
policy
paper
refers
to
the
following
definition
the
policy
of
greek
the
art
of
managing
state
community
relations
it
one
of
the
leaders
and
of
the
organization
of
ukrainian
after
its
collapse
in
the
leader
of
one
of
its
branches
movement
thats
what
i
now
regarding
the
phrase
the
claim
that
was
not
ukrainian
and
polish
already
described
as
ak
ad
you
just
do
not
pay
attention
that
if
human
activities
affect
the
nation
as
a
whole
his
nationality
does
not
matter
we
would
like
to
know
on
what
the
ai
based
here
is
the
statement
if
human
activities
affect
the
nation
as
a
whole
his
nationality
is
not
important
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
the
ai
is
obvious
i
have
already
given
an
example
wit
consensus
and
does
not
require
the
support
of
all
parties
the
presence
of
a
consensus
does
not
mean
universal
support
for
the
selected
solution
rather
it
means
that
everyone
obey
the
chosen
solution
personally
i
believe
that
the
most
accurate
and
neutral
in
the
preamble
would
be
one
of
the
leaders
and
of
the
organization
of
ukrainian
i
think
adopted
above
a
group
of
participants
language
was
because
it
was
originally
a
negative
assessment
and
calling
the
killings
during
the
war
on
the
part
of
any
political
organizations
and
parties
to
the
conflict
as
if
it
did
not
seem
abnormal
not
something
unusual
in
the
world
your
statement
is
more
suitable
if
in
the
near
future
who
will
be
objections
should
be
replaced
i
think
it
is
better
to
wait
for
at
least
some
of
the
reaction
of
others
today
you
have
violated
the
consensus
yes
one
more
you
have
removed
references
to
the
organization
of
ukrainian
it
with
the
organization
of
ukrainian
movement
let
us
then
so
write
one
of
the
leaders
and
of
the
organization
of
ukrainian
after
its
collapse
in
the
leader
of
one
of
its
branches
movement
not
collapse
and
split
otherwise
i
agree
logical
i
am
also
in
favor
and
contemporary
public
opinion
dear
your
edit
is
legitimate
only
when
a
consensus
on
it
at
the
moment
the
consensus
is
not
only
not
achieved
but
it
did
not
end
the
discussion
as
you
can
see
if
you
carefully
the
superior
discussion
in
this
case
you
are
making
a
significant
even
without
in
the
discussion
not
only
making
in
the
comments
you
warned
about
the
responsibility
for
the
which
is
contrary
to
common
sense
one
may
get
the
impression
that
you
are
unfounded
personal
point
of
view
let
me
tell
you
if
you
would
be
interested
that
section
is
called
and
contemporary
public
opinion
the
subject
of
this
section
does
not
imply
denial
of
the
public
opinion
in
general
and
in
particular
to
the
selected
or
entered
not
edit
refutes
and
therefore
does
not
fit
into
the
theme
section
considering
the
above
under
the
regime
of
seeking
consensus
let
me
undo
your
edit
it
seems
to
be
the
same
about
the
mere
presence
of
these

the
act

they

to

the

that
the
liquidation
of
the
ukrainian
government
is
not
good
for
relations
between

germany
intransigence

in

camp
proved
to
j
l
and
other
leaders
of
the
several
papers
have
presented
another
reason
for
his
arrest
the
authors
refer
to
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
chief
of
the
nd
division
he
gave
the
soviet
secret
service
in
officer
claimed
that
in
received
from
large
sum
of
money
to
finance
the
underground
and
the
organization
of
intelligence
but
was
trying
to
appropriate
the
money
and
transferred
them
to
the
swiss
bank
which
was
the
reason
for
his
arrest
i
do
not
think
that
the
view
that
the
huge
number
of
ai
worth
especially
without
attribution
in
addition
the
credibility
of
the
source
is
in
serious
doubt
this
is
not
the
opinion
of
heres
what
he
wrote
in
principle
ai
though
not
one
of
the
leading
ukrainian
historians
hes
in
his
textbook
refers
to
one
of
the
soviet
publications
the
author
of
which
credibility
is
in
serious
doubt
here
is
a
link
to
an
who
is
in
a
network
it
is
clearly
written
shortly
after
the
termination
due
to

arrested
for
trying
to
form
a
ukrainian
government
in
to
rush
due
to
was
used
the
fact
that
the
latter
in
received
from
the
a
large
sum
of
money
to
finance
the
underground
created
to
organize
subversive
activities
trying
to
assign
and
moved
to
one
of
the
swiss
banks
where
they
were
taken
by
us
and
again
returned
to
from
a
fragment
of
the
shows
that
there
is
no
causal
link
between
the
transfer
of
money
to
the
bank
and
there
was
no
arrest
and
said
that
was
arrested
for
trying
to
form
the
ukrainian
government
in
i
agree
bu
a
fragment
from
the
testimony
about
money
is
extremely
doubtful
try
to
find
a
logical
answers
to
the
questions
how
can
extract
money
from
the
swiss
bank
account
of
given
the
fact
that
the
germans
could
not
have
the
same
way
to
withdraw
money
from
swiss
bank
accounts
with
the
nazis
jews
why
return
the
money
if
he
so
to
speak
caught
stealing
to
operations
to
seize
money
is
available
to

after
the

at
the

is
the

nothing

famous

almost
all
the

into
any

but
also
written
without

even

not
a

though
we
all
know
hes
great

demands
to
refrain
from
such
in
the
preamble
from
the
rest
of
the
text
it
is
clear
that
outstanding
and
prominent
assessment
of
personality
i
think
that
this
one
paragraph
fully
according
to
was
a
man
he
preferred
the
historical
literature
and
of
political
figures
including
foreign
ones
german
polish
and
technical
in
addition
he
had
the
ability
to
speak
eloquently
and
convincingly
but
at
the
same
time
able
to
listen
without
him
distinguished
by
a
good
sense
of
humor
he
is
particularly
fond
of
listening
to
someone
telling
funny
stories
at
was
according
to
those
who
knew
him
a
phenomenal
memory
he
had
a
wide
range
of
interests
trying
to
lead
an
active
life
and
all
that
interested
him
had
a
complete
picture
he
knew
how
to
be
a
good
friend
and
a
nice
boss
recalled

the

so
before
you
appoint
someone
to
a
senior
position
in
the
organization
he
was
trying
to
take
some
time
especially
if
he
was
not
personally
acquainted
with
the

by
high
organizational
skills

fact

the

his

powerful

recalled
that
was

staunch

i
can
not
imagine
that
it
has
for
example
money
and
his
friends
had
not
all
proposals
agreed
whose
opinion
they
reflect
so
up
to
the
reviews
about
the
memory
of
not
be
any
sort
of
attribution
why
the
previous
text
is
perceived
as
a
kind
of
absolute
truth
according
to
his
refer
to
the
last
page
it
often
happens
that
the
last
reference
is
general
in
nature
because
duplicate
it
several
times
in
a
single
paragraph
then
it
must
be
said
at
the
beginning
of
bear
ie
if
the
first
three
statements
as
well
as
the
statement
of
memory
made
the
book
sense
of
humor
and
communication
skills
in
fact
in
this
way
and
are
often
if
a
book
communication
skills
are
presented
as
absolute
truth
then
it
is
an
absolute
truth
for
of
any
personal
qualities
any
person
can
make
peremptory
judgment
on
a
single
source
and
on
two
or
three
too
subjective
thing
if
it
is
a
man
who
valued
polar
true
tenfold
this
calls
for
consensus
on
a
large
number
of
authors
at
least
with
neutral
and
preferably
with
a
negative
mood
as
little
as
a
historian
is
positively
by
the
figure
of
joseph
but
his
outstanding
oratory
emphasize
all
while
there
is
no
consensus
on
the
sources
you
need
to
attribute
this
is
not
difficult
of
reading
gnat
replace
i
life
sentence
for
the
glorification
of
in
this
case
it
is
not
about
a
phrase
expressed
in
this
debate
and
the
bill
by
from
the
ruling
party
s
of
course
be
accepted
for
example
the
will
vote
in
plenary
this
proposal
looks
a
natural
extension
of
thought
the
residents
of
eastern
as
well
as
poland
and
russia
regard
him
mostly
negative
fascism
terrorism
radical
nationalism
and
an
well
if
you
vote
for
all
of
the
which
is
sure
to
happen
the
law
could
be
adopted
even
vote
for
it
not
all
votes
may
well
determine
the
outcome
of
the
vote
with
regards
to
the
nonsense
wel
how
will
well
it
is
quite
normal
information
on
the
subject
of
the
article
if
a
project
is
discussed
in
the
body
power
state
level
it
is
really
high
importance
and
the
fact
that
the
are
on
the
lists
to
the
parliament
and
there
can
form
a
substantial
opinion
means
sufficient
importance
to
their
views
of
modern
ukrainian
politics
in
the
us
because
the

not
pass
and
vote
here
argument
still
generally
invalid
what
he
did
after
and
marks
still
no
less
out
of
some
general
facts
as
his
memory
is
anothe
elected
by
majority
districts
in
a
member
of
the
ruling
party
of
regions
even
made
the
initiative
to
introduce
penalties
for
glorification
of
up
to

imprisonment
too
few
the
article
is
not
about

about

a
penalty
for
glorification
of
up
to
life
imprisonment
link
and
one
more
thing
so
far
i
can
only
see
the
arguments
of
the
form
that
odious
and
you
yourself
are
what
or
let
them
take
a
cake
from
the
shelf
as
they
say
the
level
of
reasoning
is
through
the
roof
well
actually
now
exactly
clear
what
purpose
the
article
about
this
character
placed
on
the
title
i
you
really
do
not
understand
the
difference
between
a
member
of
the
ruling
party
and
a
deputy
from
the
opposition
well
the
difference
is
very
simple
what
makes
a
ruling
party
that
is
usually
taken
and
that
the
opposition
of
course
it
would
be
interesting
to
discuss
with
you
the
current
political
situation
in
and
to
find
out
for
example
what
is
the
difference
between
from
the
government
and
the
opposition
or
to
present
the
implications
of
this
bill
but
all
this
is
irrelevant
to
the
discussion
paper
i
believe
that
at
this
point
its
just
a
marginal
policy
statement
say
so
with
a
certain
reputation
which
was
dressed
in
a
written
form
if
this
law
will
be
submitted
to
a
vote
then
can
and
should
add
this
information
to
the
article
about
im
afraid
to
upset
you
but
this
marginal
exactly
reflect
the
views
of
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
population
of
southeast
do
you
think
that
those
who
are
in
the
southeast
the
communist
vote
views
about
somehow
different
from
those
of
regions
elected
there
so
based
on
that
this
statement
can
not
be
as
if
it
is
personal
to
you
and
may
be
unpleasant
all
that
is
happening
i
do
not
understand
the
importance
of
this
bill
is
determined
by
the
fact
that
his
proposed
deputy
of
the
ruling
party
or
the
fact
that
it
the
opinion
of
a
certain
part
of
the
population
in
the
first
case
it
has
not
been
supported
by
the
faction
on
the
least
premature
to
add
any
reference
to
this
in
the
second
so
more
accurately
express
the
views
of
the
most
convinced
of
the
electorate
freedom
but
this
is
not
a
reason
to
add
his
remarks
in
the
article
when
the
to
this
statement
my
personal
opinion
on
this
is
likely
to
leave
with
you
this
is
not
a
forum
so
give
it
i
will
not
its
not
clear
your
desire
to
add
old
is
in
the
article
not
in
the
article
where
it
would
be
out
of
place
december
i
personally
have
absolutely
no
objection
to
the
article
was
something
like
in
believe
idol
elected
by
majority
districts
in
from
said
did
theres
a
lot
of
material
you
need
to
select
the
most
characteristic
in
the
south
east
considered
a
criminal
and
a
terrorist
elected
by
majority
districts
in
from
the
party
of
regions
suggested
glorification
of
up
to
life
imprisonment
absolutely
do
not
understand
why
such
information
would
be
out
of
place
in
this
article
my
had
not
been
canceled
but
if
you
wish
just
add
to
it
in
my
opinion
the
problem
is
what
to
politicians
is
one
of
the
eternal
themes
however
consistently
reflecting
the
political
statements
in
the
article
on
the
topic
a
similar
section
soon
would
violate
weight
in
order
to
highlight
the
flow
of
information
from
all
the
most
important
statements
suggestions
and
opinions
of
politicians
who
do
not
have
scientific
value
it
needs
a
good
view
of
the
ai
the
issue
we
do
not
write
about
politics
but
about
the
fact
that
in
different
parts
of
the
state
of
to
figure
completely
different
attitude
in
this
part
of
the
preamble
are
talking
about
it
and
its
quite
a
different
attitude
can
be
illustrated
with
just
one
typical
example
the
author
of
the
example
is
to
be
the
type
of
person
that
is
elected
by
the
local
population
there
which
means
that
it
really
is
representative
for
the
appropriate
place
and
the
best
way
to
do
this
right
for
rada
the
one
hand
they
are
elected
by
the
field
not
all
and
the
other
i
must
admit
that
your
opinion
on
the
role
and
place
of
in
the
ukrainian
political
life
is
very
original
as
well
as
the
conclusion
that
the
political
discourse
around
in
should
be
limited
only
display
items
and
i
believe
that
this
position
is
purely
your
vision
of
the
problem
which
in
this
respect
is
quite
contrary
to
the
principles
of
such
as
vp
ai
vp
weight
your
cue
indicates
only
that
you
know
the
names
of
different
rules
to
but
none
of
them
have
not
read
on
a
purely
visceral
level
i
suspect
that
your
statement
is
on
the
verge
of
the
ep
ep
i
thats
just
about
anything
does
not
say
for
example
the
same
management
was
supportive
of
other
law
deviation
see
law
of
on
the
basis
of
state
language
policy
as
a
result
the
law
was
adopted
and
entered
into
force
but
thats
not
it
the
fact
that
the
opinion
to
use
not
because
it
will
become
law
and
may
well
be
then
the
probability
of
but
because
it
the
position
of
the
southeast
on
the
issue
and
in
this
context
as
it
is
me
and
been
introduced
this
opinion
has
value
regardless
of
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
the
law
this
is
no
more
than
the
relation
of
mr
by
the
way
yet
no
one
has
managed
to
prove
so
apply
the
this
bill
probability
of
acceptance
is
much
lower
than
directed
against
the
etc
still
need
to
try
and
oh
so
mr
in
parliament
is
not
himself
and
at
a
minimum
the
city
of
which
elected
him
fully
aware
of
what
his
views
and
separate
them
your
personal
attitude
to
i
honestly
care
little
and
do
not
read
this
page
for
you
to
write
it
here
there
are
you
know
and
blogs
i
had
political
inflate
here
is
how
these
arguments
are
the
rules
of
i
believe
that
information
should
be
in
the
article
regardless
of
the
chances
of
the
adoption
of
the
bill
on
the
personality
and
the
of
its
opinion
in
eastern
lets
see
step
by
step
a
quite
prominent
and
ukrainian
politician
member
of
the
supreme
legislative
body
of
the
country
this
makes
it
a
potentially
significant
opinions
about
whatever
was
discussed
b
according
to
the
ep
weight
article
should
reflect
the
views
are
sufficiently
covered
sources
only
one
request
in
gives
references
to
articles
in
the
media
directly
related
to
this
bill
or
a
reaction
to
it
i
believe
that
this
number
is
sufficient
for
a
brief
mention
of
the
fact
in
the
article
since
this
method
does
not
affect
the
search
of
ukrainian
sources
the
actual
lighting
is
probably
much
higher
c
shove
the
opinion
of
each
of
the
type
x
said
the
savior
of
the
nation
y
a
genius
z
the
best
son
of
the
ukrainian
people
different
versions
of
praise
a
called
bandit
b
scum
c
nazi
insults
i
have
to
admit
your
argument
is
very
convincing
however
the
history
of
the
bill
shows
only
a
part
of
the
political
struggle
which
is
currently
around
as
well
as
the
history
of
the
at
the
moment
the
topic
is
not
addressed
in
the
article
except
the
story
by
a
subject
title
of
hero
of
and
then
there
is
the
practical
question
topic
of
political
struggle
around
the
name
of
if
addressed
in
authoritative
sources
according
to
rule
vi
can
act
the
subject
of
another
article
while
yes
most
likely
this
article
will
focus
on
the
broader
issue
at
least
for
the
opponents
of
is
inseparable
from
other
nationalist
leaders
probably
will
do
so
when
the
volume
of
such
information
here
is
too
great
so
far
and
adding
a
single
fact
which
it
for
articles
about

more
so
th
th
hmm
her
actuall
this
issue
within
the
framework
of
the
ep
should
be
treated
chatting
on
says
in
the
past
tense
although
many
issues
still
unresolved
and
the
establishment
of
the
monument
in
adopted
a
resolution
on
the
declaration
of

i
agree
with
the
previous
remarks
that
the
opinion
as
the
opinion
significant
current

but
the
fact
that
journalists
are
then
carried
in
the
offers
to
give
life
for
the
glorification
of
if
this
is
the
tag
journalists
write
of

do
not

i
myself
can
not

of
so
and
so
lets
not
bring
the
discussion
to
some
already
absurdity
such
laws
do
not
exist
of
course
the
draft
it
comes
to
rehabilitation
and
glorification
of
nazi
and
since
everyone
knows
that
this
formulation
has
in
mind
first
of
all
all
the
journalists
have
written
is
all
completely
correct
by
thinking
adoption
of
this
law
really
should
lead
to
the
fact
that
heroes
of
will
be
just
at
home
in
the
kitchen
but
those
who
would
deal
with
the
outside
is
to
be
with
regards
to
the
fact
that
people
elected
by
an
overwhelming
majority
in
the
corresponding
districts
do
not
represent
the
dominant
opinion
of
the
residents
of
this
district
editors
vp
did
not
have
to
thinking
the
and
interpret
facts
directly
of
has
spoken
and
the
law
on
word
this
is
a
fact
what
implies
called
nazi
long
before
the
chat
to
the
chief
editor
who
was
the
other
day
here
for
example
what
he
said
in
over
the
five
years
of
country
such
actions
debate
is
clearly
not
at
the
track
of
course
you
can
continue
position
but
the
article
is
not
about
him
initially
edit
read
that
elected
by
majority
districts
in
a
member
of
the
ruling
party
of
regions
even
made
the
initiative
to
introduce
penalties
for
glorification
of
up
to
life
imprisonment
yes
he
has
a
position
on
the
subject
which
he
had
expressed
in
the
past
but
the
current
resonance
caused
it
in
his
remarks
the
chief
editor
but
they
did
not
say
it
directly
like
introduce
penalties
for
glorification
of
up
to
life
imprisonment
later
to
him
on
this
initially
was
basically
flawed
the
bill
itself
does
not
contain
any
mention
of
and
i
believe
that
at
least
until
it
became
law
or
at
least
not
caused
a
response
that
would
be
in
the
media
would
be
lit
the
mention
of
the
bill
at
least
in
this
article
is
not
justified
also
presented
an
alternative
bill
which
following
also
worth
to
say
because
the
significance
of
his
no
less
but
in
both
legislative
not
directly
mentioned
and
such
a
detailed
description
of
the
legal
struggle
over
the
history
of
ukrainian
nationalism
in
the
biographical
article
find
it
unnecessary
personally
i
think
that
the
fascist
above
all
it
called
miller
and
not
to
mention
the
ss
division
but
further
discussion
of
the
interpretation
of
this
law
without
ai
is
hopeless
the
importance
of
the
position
not
think
so
that
an
exception
to
the
present
article
even
in
conjunction
in
any
case
this
will
be
the
position
only
out
of
elected
by
the
majority
principle
obviously
as
requires
lighting
not
only
polar
positions
as
vp
weight
suggests
that
not
only
the
position
of
and
should
be
represented
this
issue
could
be
with
a
good
source
which
parse
the
historical
memory
of
and
existing
political
positions
on
the
topic
but
these
materials
have
been
reported
in
fact
such
ai
you
think
and
engage
the
priori
instead
you
offer
a
typical
ep
based
on
their
own
understanding
of
the
current
political
process
in
read
the
rules
to
which
you
refer
no
i
do
not
propose

suggest
only
display
polar
positions
here
we
have
a
range
of
views
on
this
issue
and
polar
positions
positions
of
significant
ukrainian
politicians
are
the
position
and
everything
else
is
somehow
in
between
it
is
quite
normal
for
writing
encyclopedia
articles
read
the

together
original

serves
to

the
fact
that
the
polar

the

is
a
result
of
your
personal
analysis
why
and
and
do
not
say
and
suppose
unfortunate
bill
among
the

why
you

why

you
did

it
is

it
is
extreme
for

in

may
not
have
broad

i
do
not

that
the
position
such
as

be
identical
in
this
respect
with
in
contrast
to
the
position
of
the
who
have
the

stated
that
the

calls
for

attempt
to
map
the
current
situation
in
this
matter
according
to
your
position
in
my
view
be
no
more
than
an
unpublished
analysis
or
synthesis
of
published
in
our
case
often
material
which
is
used
to
promote
a
particular
position
but
most
all
of
this
is
the
subject
of
this
article
is
not
of
course
if
there
is
no
material
that
specifically
the
situation
around
from
the
general
discourse
about
nationalism
it
is
remarkable
that
started
to
read
the
rules
and
now
for
a
moment
imagine
that
i
do
not
propose
to
write
an
article
that
their
positions
are
polar
that
would
indeed
be
a
slight
violation
of

alive

one
of

could
tell
a
story
soviet
journalist
therefore
if
the
episode
with
cats
did
take
place
it
is
not
from
an
innate
propensity
for
sadism
and
from
perhaps
unwise
desire
to
check
yourself
if
you
can
take

life
of
another

that
in

latter
case
find
out
when
you
read

speech
at

in
note
that
i
have
no
in
this
regard
did
not
take
the
opposite
authors
in
this
context
it
is
also
interesting
information
here
to
be
honest
i
have
the
impression
that
the
story
of
the
cat
has
the
same
source
ie
source
of
this
information
is
just
one
author
i
have
the
impression
no
ai
and
on
anyway
does
not
pass
here
nicholas
ii
almost
fires
back
cats
as
he
wrote
in
his
diaries
and
even
on
this
nothing
if
you
are
very
concerned
about
the
lives
of
cats
i
suggest
starting
with
hagiography
because
there
are
all
clear
who
d
i
question
the
credibility
of
n
poet
and
writer
did
not
have
the
profile
of
history
education
and
scientific
titles
of
course
her
book
is
not
actually
a
vp
ai
and
is
a
primary
source
besides
with
not
personally
met
so
the
story
of
the
cats
is
doubly
doubtful
that
is
not
the
question
of
ai
of
the
primary
source
if
the
episode
with
cats
actually
took
place
doubt
not
while
which
deserves
credit
for
writing
a
good
and
interesting
book
but
not
neutral
in
regard
to
the
character
of
the
book
then
the
question
arises
th
tha
again
brought
up
the
topic
i
will
continue
information
takes
place
it
is
prevalent
and
cited
according
to
the
rule
of
marginal
theories
marginal
theory
should
be
seriously
considered
in
detail
and
at
least
one
major
publication
as
the
base
value
approach
and
sharply
negative
references
publication
elder
in
his
secret
history
of
is
the
book
was
if
im
not
mistaken
it
as
criticism
and
praise
kindly
do
not
look
for
links
the
proposal
is
as
close
as
possible
almost
verbatim
the
of
the
text
otherwise
the
article
should
be
seriously
cleaned
of
all
as
in
particular
the
knife
would
have
to
go
to
information
remembered
that
as
a
child
he
was
preparing
to
fight
for
the
freedom
of
unknown
to
adults
torturing
yourself
chain
and
needles
thus
preparing
to
police
torture
since
the
then
the
judgment
should
not
be
given
and
if
you
build
a
circuit
cats
beat
his
pregnant
wife
you
get
was
a
sadist
not
prepared
to
fight
however
given
that
in
such
a
case
an
article
that
is
beautiful
work
you
can
simply
destroy
the
striking
definition
both
the
right
and
the
left
on
the
basis
of
source
and
as
mentioned
above
the
problem
is
that
currently
there
is
no
scientific
devoted
entirely
to
the
study
of
life
so
that
it
is
easier
to
add
information
and
to
forget
especially
given
its
than
raise
issues
that
it
will
explode
dixi
i
have
no
objection
but
note
book
as
an
example
of
a
major
publication
we
can
not
help
because

not

not

time
nor
the
inclination
however
if
you
continue
to
follow
the
path
of
a
circular
discussion
you
have
to
spend
a
few
hours
of
time
to
write

submit
an
appropriate
